<span style="margin-left: 3em;">LANGHORN&mdash;<i>Genius and Valour.</i></span><br>
<br>

<p>Such are the verses, in which a modern bard has painted the desolate
state of Scotland, during a period highly unfavourable to poetical
composition. Yet the civil and religious wars of the seventeenth century
have afforded some subjects for traditionary poetry, and the reader is
here presented with the ballads of that disastrous aera. Some prefatory
history may not be unacceptable.</p>

<p>That the Reformation was a good and a glorious work, few will be such
slavish bigots as to deny. But the enemy came, by night, and sowed tares
among the wheat; or rather; the foul and rank soil, upon which the seed
was thrown, pushed forth, together with the rising crop, a plentiful
proportion of pestilential weeds. The morals of the reformed clergy were
severe; their learning was usually respectable, sometimes profound;
and their eloquence, though often coarse, was vehement, animated, and
popular. But they never could forget, that their rise had been achieved
by the degradation, if not the fall, of the crown; and hence, a body of
men, who, in most countries, have been attached to monarchy, were in
Scotland, for nearly two centuries, sometimes the avowed enemies, always
the ambitious rivals, of their prince. The disciples of Calvin could
scarcely avoid a tendency to democracy, and the republican form of
church government was sometimes hinted at, as no unfit model for the
state; at least, the kirkmen laboured to impress, upon their followers
and hearers, the fundamental principle, that the church should be solely
governed by those, unto whom God had given the spiritual sceptre. The
elder Melvine, in a conference with James VI., seized the monarch by the
sleeve, and, addressing him as <i>God's sillie vassal</i>, told him, &quot;There
are two kings, and two kingdomes. There is Christ, and his kingdome, the
kirke; whose subject King James the sixth is, and of whose kingdome he
is not a king, nor a head, nor a lord, but a member; and they, whom
Christ hath called and commanded to watch ower his kirke, and govern his
spiritual kingdome, have sufficient authorise and power from him so to
do; which no christian king, no prince, should controul or discharge,
but fortifie and assist: otherwise they are not faithful subjects to
Christ.&quot;&mdash;<i>Calderwood</i>, p. 329. The delegated theocracy, thus sternly
claimed, was exercised with equal rigour. The offences in the king's
household fell under their unceremonious jurisdiction, and he was
formally reminded of his occasional neglect to say grace before and
after meat&mdash;his repairing to hear the word more rarely than was
fitting&mdash;his profane banning and swearing, and keeping of evil
company&mdash;and finally, of his queen's carding, dancing, night-walking,
and such like profane pastimes.&mdash;<i>Calderwood</i>, p. 313. A curse, direct
or implied, was formally denounced against every man, horse, and spear,
who should assist the king in his quarrel with the Earl of Gowrie; and
from the pulpit, the favourites of the listening sovereign were likened
to Haman, his wife to Herodias, and he himself to Ahab, to Herod, and
to Jeroboam. These effusions of zeal could not be very agreeable to the
temper of James: and accordingly, by a course of slow, and often crooked
and cunning policy, he laboured to arrange the church-government upon
a less turbulent and menacing footing. His eyes were naturally turned
towards the English hierarchy, which had been modelled, by the despotic
Henry VIII., into such a form, as to connect indissolubly the interest
of the church with that of the regal power.<a name="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1"><sup>[A]</sup></a> The Reformation, in
England, had originated in the arbitrary will of the prince; in
Scotland, and in all other countries of Europe, it had commenced among
insurgents of the lower ranks. Hence, the deep and essential
difference which separated the Huguenots, the Lutherans, the Scottish
presbyterians, and, in fine, all the other reformed churches, from that
of England. But James, with a timidity which sometimes supplies the
place of prudence, contented himself with gradually imposing upon the
Scottish nation a limited and moderate system of episcopacy, which,
while it gave to a proportion of the churchmen a seat in the council of
the nation, induced them to look up to the sovereign, as the power to
whose influence they owed their elevation. But, in other respects, James
spared the prejudices of his subjects; no ceremonial ritual was imposed
upon their consciences; the pastors were reconciled by the prospect of
preferment,<a name="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2"><sup>[B]</sup></a> the dress and train of the bishops were plain and decent;
the system of tythes was placed upon a moderate and unoppressive
footing;<a name="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3"><sup>[C]</sup></a> and, perhaps, on the whole, the Scottish hierarchy contained
as few objectionable points as any system of church-government in
Europe. Had it subsisted to the present day, although its doctrines
could not have been more pure, nor its morals more exemplary, than those
of the present kirk of Scotland, yet its degrees of promotion might have
afforded greater encouragement to learning, and objects of laudable
ambition to those, who might dedicate themselves to its service. But
the precipitate bigotry of the unfortunate Charles I. was a blow to
episcopacy in Scotland, from which it never perfectly recovered.</p>

<a name="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1">[A]</a><div class="note"><p> Of this the Covenanters were so sensible, as to trace
(what they called) the Antichristian hierarchy, with its idolatry,
superstition, and human inventions, &quot;to the prelacy of England, the
fountain whence all these Babylonish streams issue unto us.&quot;&mdash;See their
manifesto on entering England, in 1640.</p></div>

<a name="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2">[B]</a><div class="note"><p> Many of the preachers, who had been loudest in the cause of
presbytery, were induced to accept of bishoprics. Such was, for example,
William Cooper, who was created bishop of Galloway. This recreant Mass
John was a hypochondriac, and conceived his lower extremities to be
composed of glass; hence, on his court advancement, the following
epigram was composed:
</p><p><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>&quot;Aureus heu! frugilem confregit malleus urnam.&quot;</i></span></p></div><br>

<a name="Footnote_C_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_C_3">[C]</a><div class="note"><p> This part of the system was perfected in the reign of
Charles I.</p></div>

<p>It has frequently happened, that the virtues of the individual, at least
their excess (if, indeed, there can be an excess in virtue), have been
fatal to the prince. Never was this more fully exemplified than in the
history of Charles I. His zeal for religion, his family affection, the
spirit with which he defended his supposed rights, while they do honour
to the man, were the fatal shelves upon which the monarchy was wrecked.
Impatient to accomplish the total revolution, which his father's
cautious timidity had left incomplete, Charles endeavoured at once to
introduce into Scotland the church-government, and to renew, in England,
the temporal domination, of his predecessor, Henry VIII. The furious
temper of the Scottish nation first took fire; and the brandished
footstool of a prostitute<a name="FNanchor_A_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_4"><sup>[A]</sup></a> gave the signal for civil dissension,
which ceased not till the church was buried under the ruins of the
constitution; till the nation had stooped to a military despotism; and
the monarch to the block of the executioner.</p>

<a name="Footnote_A_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_4">[A]</a><div class="note"><p> &quot;<i>Out, false loon! wilt thou say the mass at my lug
(ear)</i>,&quot; was the well known exclamation of Margaret Geddes, as she
discharged her missile tripod against the bishop of Edinburgh, who,
in obedience to the orders of the privy-council, was endeavouring to
rehearse the common prayer. Upon a seat more elevated, the said Margaret
had shortly before done penance, before the congregation, for the sin of
fornication: such, at least, is the tory tradition.</p></div>

<p>The consequence of Charles' hasty and arbitrary measures were soon
evident. The united nobility, gentry, and clergy of Scotland, entered
into the SOLEMN LEAGUE AND COVENANT, by which memorable deed, they
subscribed and swore a national renunciation of the hierarchy. The walls
of the prelatic Jericho (to use the language of the times) were thus
levelled with the ground, and the curse of Hiel, the Bethelite,
denounced against those who should rebuild them. While the clergy
thundered, from the pulpits, against the prelatists and malignants (by
which names were distinguished the scattered and heartless adherents of
Charles), the nobility and gentry, in arms, hurried to oppose the march
of the English army, which now advanced towards their borders. At the
head of their defensive forces they placed Alexander Lesley, who, with
many of his best officers, had been trained to war under the great
Gustavus Adolphus. They soon assembled an army of 26,000 men, whose
camp, upon Dunse-law, is thus described by an eye-witness.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr Baillie acknowledges, that it was an agreeable feast to his eyes,
to survey the place: it is a round hill, about a Scots mile in circle,
rising, with very little declivity, to the height of a bow-shot, and the
head somewhat plain, and near a quarter of a mile in length and breadth;
on the top it was garnished with near forty field pieces, pointed
towards the east and south. The colonels, who were mostly noblemen, as
Rothes, Cassilis, Eglinton, Dalhousie, Lindsay, Lowdon, Boyd, Sinclair,
Balcarras, Flemyng, Kirkcudbright, Erskine, Montgomery, Yester, &amp;c.
lay in large tents at the head of their respective regiments; their
captains, who generally were barons, or chief gentlemen, lay around
them: next to these were the lieutenants, who were generally old
veterans, and had served in that, or a higher station, over sea; and the
common soldiers lay outmost, all in huts of timber, covered with divot,
or straw. Every company, which, according to the first plan, did consist
of two hundred men, had their colours flying at the captain's tent door,
with the Scots arms upon them, and this motto, in golden letters, &quot;FOR
CHRIST'S CROWN AND COVENANT.&quot; Against this army, so well arrayed and
disciplined, and whose natural hardihood was edged and exalted by a high
opinion of their sacred cause, Charles marched at the head of a large
force, but divided, by the emulation of the commanders, and enervated,
by disuse of arms. A faintness of spirit pervaded the royal army, and
the king stooped to a treaty with his Scottish subjects. The treaty was
soon broken; and, in the following year, Dunse-law again presented the
same edifying spectacle of a presbyterian army. But the Scots were not
contented with remaining there. They passed the Tweed; and the English
troops, in a skirmish at Newburn, shewed either more disaffection,
or cowardice, than had at any former period disgraced their national
character. This war was concluded by the treaty of Rippon; in
consequence of which, and of Charles's concessions, made during his
subsequent visit to his native country, the Scottish parliament
congratulated him on departing &quot;a contented king, from a contented
people.&quot; If such content ever existed, it was of short duration.</p>

<p>The storm, which had been soothed to temporary rest in Scotland, burst
forth in England with treble violence. The popular clamour accused
Charles, or his ministers, of fetching into Britain the religion of
Rome, and the policy of Constantinople. The Scots felt most keenly the
first, and the English the second, of these aggressions. Accordingly,
when the civil war of England broke forth, the Scots nation, for a time,
regarded it in neutrality, though not with indifference. But, when the
successes of a prelatic monarch, against a presbyterian parliament, were
paving the way for rebuilding the system of hierarchy, they could no
longer remain inactive. Bribed by the delusive promise of Sir Henry
Vane, and Marshall, the parliamentary commissioners, that the church of
England should be reformed, <i>according to the word of God</i>, which, they
fondly believed, amounted to an adoption of presbytery, they agreed to
send succours to their brethren of England. Alexander Lesly, who ought
to have ranked among the <i>contented</i> subjects, having been raised by the
king to the honours of Earl of Leven, was, nevertheless, readily induced
to accept the command of this second army. Doubtless, where insurrection
is not only pardoned, but rewarded, a monarch has little right to expect
gratitude for benefits, which all the world, as well as the receiver,
must attribute to fear. Yet something is due to decency; and the best
apology for Lesly, is his zeal for propagating presbyterianism in
England, the bait which had caught the whole parliament of Scotland.
But, although the Earl of Leven was commander in chief, David Lesly, a
yet more renowned and active soldier than himself, was major-general of
the cavalry, and, in truth, bore away the laurels of the expedition.</p>

<p>The words of the following march, which was played in the van of this
presbyterian crusade, were first published by Allan Ramsay, in his
<i>Evergreen</i>; and they breathe the very spirit we might expect. Mr
Ritson, in his collection of Scottish songs, has favoured the public
with the music, which seems to have been adapted to the bagpipes.</p>

<p>The hatred of the old presbyterians to the organ was, apparently,
invincible. It is here vilified with the name of a &quot;<i>chest-full of
whistles</i>,&quot; as the episcopal chapel at Glasgow was, by the vulgar,
opprobriously termed the <i>Whistling Kirk</i>. Yet, such is the revolution
of sentiment upon this, as upon more important points, that reports have
lately been current, of a plan to introduce this noble instrument into
presbyterian congregations.</p>

<p>The share, which Lesly's army bore in the action of Marston Moor, has
been exalted, or depressed, as writers were attached to the English or
Scottish nations, to the presbyterian or independent factions. Mr Laing
concludes, with laudable impartiality, that the victory was equally due
to &quot;Cromwell's iron brigade of disciplined independents, and to three
regiments of Lesly's horse.&quot;&mdash;Vol I. p. 244.</p>

<br>

<p>THE BATTLE OF PHILIPHAUGH.</p>
<br>

<p>This ballad is so immediately connected with the former, that the editor
is enabled to continue his sketch of historical transactions, from the
march of Lesly.</p>

<p>In the insurrection of 1680, all Scotland, south from the Grampians, was
actively and zealously engaged. But, after the treaty of Rippon, the
first fury of the revolutionary torrent may be said to have foamed off
its force, and many of the nobility began to look round, with horror,
upon the rocks and shelves amongst which it had hurried them. Numbers
regarded the defence of Scotland as a just and necessary warfare, who
did not see the same reason for interfering in the affairs of England.
The visit of King Charles to the metropolis of his fathers, in all
probability, produced its effect on his nobles. Some were allied to
the house of Stuart by blood; all regarded it as the source of their
honours, and venerated the ancient in obtaining the private objects of
ambition, or selfish policy which had induced them to rise up against
the crown. Amongst these late penitents, the well known marquis of
Montrose was distinguished, as the first who endeavoured to recede from
the paths of rude rebellion. Moved by the enthusiasm of patriotism, or
perhaps of religion, but yet more by ambition, the sin of noble
minds, Montrose had engaged, eagerly and deeply, upon the side of the
covenanters He had been active in pressing the town of Aberdeen to take
the covenant, and his success against the Gordons, at the bridge of Dee,
left that royal burgh no other means of safety from pillage. At the head
of his own battalion, he waded through the Tweed, in 1640, and totally
routed the vanguard of the king's cavalry. But, in 1643, moved with
resentment against the covenanters who preferred, to his prompt and
ardent character, the caution of the wily and politic earl of Argyle, or
seeing, perhaps, that the final views of that party were inconsistent
with the interests of monarchy, and of the constitution, Montrose
espoused the falling cause of royalty and raised the Highland clans,
whom he united to a small body of Irish, commanded by Alexander
Macdonald, still renowned in the north, under the title of Colkitto.
With these tumultuary and uncertain forces, he rushed forth, like a
torrent from the mountains, and commenced a rapid and brilliant career
of victory. At Tippermoor, where he first met the covenanters, their
defeat was so effectual, as to appal the presbyterian courage, even
after the lapse of eighty years.<a name="FNanchor_A_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_5"><sup>[A]</sup></a> A second army was defeated under the
walls of Aberdeen; and the pillage of the ill-fated town was doomed to
expiate the principles, which Montrose himself had formerly imposed upon
them. Argyleshire next experienced his arms; the domains of his rival
were treated with more than military severity; and Argyle himself,
advancing to Inverlochy for the defence of his country, was totally
and disgracefully routed by Montrose. Pressed betwixt two armies,
well appointed, and commanded by the most experienced generals of the
Covenant, Mozitrose displayed more military skill in the astonishingly
rapid marches, by which he avoided fighting to disadvantage, than even
in the field of victory. By one of those hurried marches, from the banks
of Loch Katrine to the heart of Inverness-shire, he was enabled to
attack, and totally to defeat, the Covenanters, at Aulderne though he
brought into the field hardly one half of their forces. Baillie, a
veteran officer, was next routed by him, at the village of Alford,
in Strathbogie. Encouraged by these repeated and splendid successes,
Montrose now descended into the heart of Scotland, and fought a bloody
and decisive battle, near Kilsyth, where four thousand covenanters fell
under the Highland claymore.</p>

<a name="Footnote_A_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_5">[A]</a><div class="note"><p> Upon the breaking out of the insurrection, in the year
1715, the earl of Rothes, sheriff and lord-lieutenant of the county of
Fife, issued out an order for &quot;all the fencible men of the countie to
meet him, at a place called Cashmoor. The gentlemen took no notice of
his orders, nor did the commons, except those whom the ministers forced
to goe to the place of rendezvouse, to the number of fifteen hundred
men, being all that their utmost diligence could perform. But those of
that countie, having been taught by their experience, that it is not
good meddling with edge tools, especiallie in the hands of Highlandmen,
were very averse from taking armes. No sooner they reflected on the name
of the place of rendezvouse, Cashmoor, than Tippermoor was called to
mind; a place not far from thence, where Montrose had routed them, when
under the command of my great-grand-uncle the earl of Wemyss, then
generall of God's armie. In a word, the unlucky choice of a place,
called <i>Moo</i>, appeared ominous; and that, with the flying report of the
Highlandmen having made themselves masters of Perth, made them throw
down their armes, and run, notwithstanding the trouble that Rothes and
the ministers gave themselves to stop them.&quot;&mdash;M.S. <i>Memoirs of Lord St

<p>This victory opened the whole of Scotland to Montrose He occupied the
capital, and marched forward to the border; not merely to complete the
subjection of the southern provinces, but with the flattering hope of
pouring his victorious army into England, and bringing to the support of
Charles the sword of his paternal tribes.</p>

<p>Half a century before Montrose's career, the state of the borders was
such as might have enabled him easily to have accomplished his daring
plan. The marquis of Douglas, the earls of Hume, Roxburgh, Traquair, and
Annandale, were all descended of mighty border chiefs, whose ancestors
could, each of them, have led into the field a body of their own
vassals, equal in numbers, and superior in discipline, to the army of
Montrose. But the military spirit of the borderers, and their attachment
to their chiefs, had been much broken since the union of the crowns. The
disarming acts of James had been carried rigorously into execution, and
the smaller proprietors, no longer feeling the necessity of protection
from their chiefs in war, had aspired to independence, and embraced
the tenets of the covenant. Without imputing, with Wishart, absolute
treachery to the border nobles, it may be allowed, that they looked with
envy upon Montrose, and with dread and aversion upon his rapacious and
disorderly forces. Hence, had it been in their power, it might not have
altogether suited their inclinations, to have brought the strength
of the border lances to the support of the northern clans. The once
formidable name of Douglas still sufficed to raise some bands, by
whom Montrose was joined, in his march down the Gala. With these
reinforcements, and with the remnant of his Highlanders (for a great
number had returned home with Colkitto, to deposit their plunder, and
provide for their families), Montrose after traversing the border,
finally encamped upon the field of Philiphaugh.</p>

<p>The river Ettrick, immediately after its junction with the Yarrow, and
previous to its falling into the Tweed, makes a large sweep to the
southward, and winds almost beneath the lofty bank, on which the town
of Selkirk stands; leaving, upon the northern side, a large and level
plain, extending in an easterly direction, from a hill, covered with
natural copse-wood, called the Harehead-wood, to the high ground which
forms the banks of the Tweed, near Sunderland-hall. This plain is called
Philliphaugh:<a name="FNanchor_A_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_6"><sup>[A]</sup></a> it is about a mile and a half in length, and a quarter
of a mile broad; and, being defended, to the northward, by the high
hills which separate Tweed from Yarrow, by the river in front, and by
the high grounds, already mentioned on each flank, it forms, at once,
a convenient and a secure field of encampment. On each flank Montrose
threw up some trenches, which are still visible; and here he posted his
infantry, amounting to about twelve or fifteen hundred men. He himself
took up his quarters in the burgh of Selkirk, and, with him, the
cavalry, in number hardly one thousand, but respectable, as being
chiefly composed of gentlemen, and their immediate retainers. In this
manner, by a fatal and unaccountable error, the river Ettrick was thrown
betwixt the cavalry and infantry, which were to depend upon each other
for intelligence and mutual support. But this might be overlooked by
Montrose, in the conviction, that there was no armed enemy of Charles
in the realm of Scotland; for he is said to have employed the night in
writing and dispatching this agreeable intelligence to the king. Such an
enemy was already within four miles of his camp.</p>

<p>Recalled by the danger of the cause of the Covenant, General David Lesly
came down from England, at the head of those iron squadrons, whose force
had been proved in the fatal battle of Long Marston Moor. His array
consisted of from five to six thousand men, chiefly cavalry. Lesly's
first plan seems to have been, to occupy the mid-land counties, so as to
intercept the return of Montrose's Highlanders, and to force him to an
unequal combat Accordingly, he marched along the eastern coast, from
Berwick to Tranent; but there he suddenly altered his direction, and,
crossing through Mid-Lothian, turned again to the southward, and,
following the course of Gala water, arrived at Melrose, the evening
before the engagement How it is possible that Montrose should have
received no notice whatever of the march of so considerable an army,
seems almost inconceivable, and proves, that the country was strongly
disaffected to his cause, or person. Still more extraordinary does it
appear, that, even with the advantage of a thick mist, Lesly should
have, the next morning, advanced towards Montrose's encampment without
being descried by a single scout. Such, however, was the case, and it
was attended with all the consequences of the most complete surprisal.
The first intimation that Montrose received of the march of Lesly,
was the noise of the conflict, or, rather, that which attended the
unresisted slaughter of his infantry, who never formed a line of battle:
the right wing alone, supported by the thickets of Harehead-wood, and
by the entrenchments which are there still visible, stood firm for some
time. But Lesly had detached two thousand men, who, crossing the Ettrick
still higher up than his main body, assaulted the rear of Montrose's
right wing. At this moment, the marquis himself arrived, and beheld
his army dispersed, for the first time, in irretrievable route. He
had thrown himself upon a horse the instant he heard the firing, and,
followed by such of his disorderly cavalry as had gathered upon the
alarm, he galloped from Selkirk, crossed the Ettrick, and made a bold
and desperate attempt to retrieve the fortune of the day. But all was
in vain; and, after cutting his way, almost singly, through a body of
Lesly's troopers, the gallant Montrose graced by his example the
retreat of the fugitives. That retreat he continued up Yarrow, and over
Minch-moor; nor did he stop till he arrived at Traquair, sixteen miles
from the field of battle. Upon Philiphaugh he lost, in one defeat, the
fruit of six splendid victories: nor was he again able effectually to
make head, in Scotland, against the covenanted cause. The number slain
in the field did not exceed three or four hundred; for the fugitives
found refuge in the mountains, which had often been the retreat of
vanquished armies, and were impervious to the pursuer's cavalry. Lesly
abused his victory, and dishonoured his arms, by slaughtering, in cold
blood, many of the prisoners whom he had taken; and the court-yard of
Newark castle is said to have been the spot, upon which they were
shot by his command. Many others are said, by Wishart, to have been
precipitated from a high bridge over the Tweed. This, as Mr Laing
remarks, is impossible; because there was not a bridge over the Tweed
betwixt Peebles and Berwick. But there is an old bridge, over the
Ettrick, only four miles from Philiphaugh, and another over the Yarrow,
both of which lay in the very line of flight and pursuit; and either
might have been the scene of the massacre. But if this is doubtful,
it is too certain, that several of the royalists were executed by the
Covenanters, as traitors to the king and parliament.<a name="FNanchor_A_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_7"><sup>[A]</sup></a></p>

<a name="Footnote_A_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_7">[A]</a><div class="note"><p> A covenanted minister, present at the execution of these
gentlemen observed, &quot;This wark gaes bonnilie on!&quot; an amiable
exclamation equivalent to the modern <i>&ccedil;a ira</i>, so often used on similar
occasions.&mdash;<i>Wishart's Memoirs of Montrose.</i></p></div>

<p>I have reviewed, at some length, the details of this memorable
engagement, which, at the same time, terminated the career of a hero,
likened, by no mean judge of mankind<a name="FNanchor_A_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_8"><sup>[A]</sup></a> to those of antiquity, and
decided the fate of his country. It is further remarkable, as the last
field which was fought in Ettrick forest, the scene of so many bloody
actions. The unaccountable neglect of patroles, and the imprudent
separation betwixt the horse and foot, seem to have been the immediate
causes of Montrose's defeat. But the ardent and impetuous character
of this great warrior, corresponding with that of the troops which he
commanded was better calculated for attack than defence; for surprising
others, rather than for providing against surprise himself. Thus, he
suffered loss by a sudden attack upon part of his forces, stationed at
Aberdeen;<a name="FNanchor_B_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_9"><sup>[B]</sup></a> and, had he not extricated himself with the most singular
ability, he must have lost his whole army, when surprised by Baillie,
during the plunder of Dundee. Nor has it escaped an ingenious modern
historian, that his final defeat at Dunbeath, so nearly resembles in its
circumstances the surprise at Philiphaugh, as to throw some shade on his
military talents.&mdash;LAING'S <i>History</i>.</p>

<a name="Footnote_B_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_9">[B]</a><div class="note"><p> Colonel Hurry, with a party of horse, surprised the town,
while Montrose's Highlanders and cavaliers were &quot;dispersed through the
town, drinking carelessly in their lodgings; and, hearing the horse's
feet, and great noise, were astonished, never dreaming of their enemy.
However, Donald Farquharson happened to come to the causey, where he was
cruelly slain, anent the Court de Guard; a brave gentleman, and one of
the noblest captains amongst all the Highlanders of Scotland. Two or
three others were killed, and some (taken prisoners) had to Edinburgh,
and cast into irons in the tolbooth. Great lamentation was made for this
gallant, being still the king's man for life and death.&quot;&mdash;SPALDING
Vol. II. p. 281. The journalist, to whom all matters were of equal
importance, proceeds to inform us, that Hurry took the marquis of
Huntly's best horse, and, in his retreat through Montrose seized upon
the marquis's second son. He also expresses his regret, that &quot;the said
Donald Farquharson's body was found in the street, stripped naked: for
they tirr'd from off his body a rich stand of apparel, but put on the
same day.&quot;&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>The following ballad, which is preserved by tradition in Selkirkshire,
coincides accurately with historical fact. This, indeed, constitutes its
sole merit. The Covenanters were not, I dare say, addicted, more
than their successors &quot;to the profane and unprofitable art of
poem-making.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_A_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_10"><sup>[A]</sup></a> Still, however, they could not refrain from some
strains of exultation, over the defeat of the <i>truculent tyrant</i>, James
Grahame. For, gentle reader, Montrose, who, with resources which seemed
as none, gained six victories, and reconquered a kingdom; who, a poet, a
scholar, a cavalier, and a general, could have graced alike a court,
and governed a camp; this Montrose was numbered, by his covenanted
countrymen, among &quot;the troublers of Israel, the fire-brands of hell, the
Corahs, the Balaams, the Doegs, the Rabshakahs, the Hamans, the Tobiahs,
and Sanballats of the time.&quot;</p>

in some parts of Scotland, that only thirty years ago, when Wilson,

formally, and in writing, to abjure <i>&quot;the profane and unprofitable art

<p>THE BATTLE OF PHILIPHAUGH.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They spy'd an aged father,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And he did draw them near.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Come hither, aged father!&quot;</span><br>

<br>

<p>NOTES ON THE BATTLE OF PHILIPHAUGH.</p>
<br>

<p><i>When they came to the Shaw burn.</i>&mdash;P. 27. v. 1. A small stream, that
joins the Ettrick, near Selkirk, on the south side of the river.</p>

<p><i>When they came to the Lingly burn.</i>&mdash;P. 27. v. 2. A brook, which falls
into the Ettrick, from the north, a little above the Shaw burn.</p>

<p><i>They spy'd an aged father.</i>&mdash;P. 27. v. 2. The traditional commentary
upon the ballad states this man's name to have been Brydone, ancestor to
several families in the parish of Ettrick, particularly those occupying
the farms of Midgehope and Redford Green. It is a strange anachronism,
to make this aged father state himself at the battle of <i>Solway flow,</i>
which was fought a hundred years before Philiphaugh; and a still
stranger, to mention that of Dunbar, which did not take place till five
years after Montrose's defeat.</p>

<p>A tradition, annexed to a copy of this ballad, transmitted to me by Mr
James Hogg, bears, that the earl of Traquair, on the day of the battle,
was advancing with a large sum of money, for the payment of Montrose's
forces, attended by a blacksmith, one of his retainers. As they crossed
Minch-moor, they were alarmed by firing, which the earl conceived to
be Montrose exercising his forces, but which his attendant, from the
constancy and irregularity of the noise, affirmed to be the tumult of an
engagement. As they came below Broadmeadows, upon Yarrow, they met their
fugitive friends, hotly pursued by the parliamentary troopers. The earl,
of course, turned, and fled also: but his horse, jaded with the weight
of dollars which he carried, refused to take the hill; so that the earl
was fain to exchange with his attendant, leaving him with the breathless
horse, and bag of silver, to shift for himself; which he is supposed
to have done very effectually. Some of the dragoons, attracted by the
appearance of the horse and trappings, gave chase to the smith, who
fled up the Yarrow; but finding himself as he said, encumbered with the
treasure, and unwilling that it should be taken, he flung it into a
well, or pond, near the Tinnies, above Hangingshaw. Many wells were
afterwards searched in vain; but it is the general belief, that the
smith, if he ever hid the money, knew too well how to anticipate the
scrutiny. There is, however, a pond, which some peasants began to drain,
not long ago, in hopes of finding the golden prize, but were prevented,
as they pretended, by supernatural interference.</p>

<br>

<p>THE GALLANT GRAHAMS.</p>
<br>

<p>The preceding ballad was a song of triumph over the defeat of Montrose
at Philiphaugh; the verses, which follow are a lamentation for his final
discomfiture and cruel death. The present edition of <i>&quot;The Gallant
Grahams&quot;</i> is given from tradition, enlarged and corrected by an ancient
printed edition, entitled, <i>&quot;The Gallant Grahams of Scotland&quot;</i> to the
tune of <i>&quot;I will away, and I will not tarry,&quot;</i> of which Mr Ritson
favoured the editor with an accurate copy.</p>

<p>The conclusion of Montrose's melancholy history is too well known. The
Scottish army, which sold king Charles I. to his parliament, had, we may
charitably hope, no idea that they were bartering his blood; although
they must have been aware, that they were consigning him to perpetual
bondage.<a name="FNanchor_A_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_12"><sup>[A]</sup></a> At least the sentiments of the kingdom at large differed
widely from those of the military merchants, and the danger of king
Charles drew into England a well appointed Scottish army, under the
command of the duke of Hamilton. But he met with Cromwell, and to meet
with Cromwell was inevitable defeat. The death of Charles, and the
triumph of the independents, excited still more highly the hatred and
the fears of the Scottish nation. The outwitted presbyterians, who saw,
too late, that their own hands had been employed in the hateful task
of erecting the power of a sect, yet more fierce and fanatical than
themselves, deputed a commission to the Hague, to treat with Charles
II., whom, upon certain conditions they now wished to restore to the
throne of his fathers. At the court of the exiled monarch, Montrose also
offered to his acceptance a splendid plan of victory and conquest, and
pressed for his permission to enter Scotland; and there, collecting the
remains of the royalists to claim the crown for his master, with the
sword in his hand. An able statesman might perhaps have reconciled these
jarring projects; a good man would certainly have made a decided choice
betwixt them. Charles was neither the one not the other; and, while he
treated with the presbyterians, with a view of accepting the crown from
their hands, he scrupled not to authorise Montrose, the mortal enemy of
the sect, to pursue his separate and inconsistent plan of conquest.</p>

<a name="Footnote_A_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_12">[A]</a><div class="note"><p> As Salmasius quaintly, but truly, expresses it,
<i>Presbyterian iligaverunt independantes trucidaverunt</i>.</p></div>

<p>Montrose arrived in the Orkneys with six hundred Germans, was furnished
with some recruits from those islands, and was joined by several
royalists, as he traversed the wilds of Caithness and Sutherland: but,
advancing into Ross-shire, he was surprised, and totally defeated,
by colonel Strachan, an officer of the Scottish parliament, who had
distinguished himself in the civil wars, and who afterwards became a
decided Cromwellian. Montrose, after a fruitless resistance, at length
fled from the field of defeat, and concealed himself in the grounds of
Macleod of Assint to whose fidelity he entrusted his life, and by whom
he was delivered up to Lesly, his most bitter enemy.</p>

<p>He was tried for what was termed treason against the estates of the
kingdom; and, despite the commission of Charles for his proceedings, he
was condemned to die by a parliament, who acknowledged Charles to be
their king, and whom, on that account only, Montrose acknowledged to be
a parliament.</p>

<p>&quot;The clergy,&quot; says a late animated historian, &quot;whose vocation it was to
persecute the repose of his last moments, sought, by the terrors of his
sentence, to extort repentance; but his behaviour, firm and dignified to
the end, repelled their insulting advances with scorn and disdain. He
was prouder, he replied, to have his head affixed to the prison-walls,
than to have his picture placed in the king's bed-chamber: 'and, far
from being troubled that my limbs are to be sent to your principal
cities, I wish I had flesh enough to be dispersed through Christendom,
to attest my dying attachment to my king.' It was the calm employment of
his mind, that night, to reduce this extravagant sentiment to verse.
He appeared next day, on the scaffold, in a rich habit, with the same
serene and undaunted countenance, and addressed the people, to vindicate
his dying unabsolved by the church, rather than to justify an invasion
of the kingdom, during a treaty with the estates. The insults of his
enemies were not yet exhausted. The history of his exploits was attached
to his neck by the public executioner: but he smiled at their inventive
malice; declared, that he wore it with more pride than he had done the
garter; and, when his devotions were finished, demanding if any more
indignities remained to be practised, submitted calmly to an unmerited
fate.&quot;&mdash;<i>Laing's History of Scotland,</i> Vol. I. p. 404.</p>

<p>Such was the death of James Graham, the great marquis of Montrose, over
whom some lowly bard has poured forth the following elegiac verses. To
say, that they are far unworthy of the subject, is no great reproach;
for a nobler poet might have failed in the attempt. Indifferent as the
ballad is, we may regret its being still more degraded by many apparent
corruptions. There seems an attempt to trace Montrose's career, from his
first raising the royal standard, to his second expedition and death;
but it is interrupted and imperfect. From the concluding stanza, I
presume the song was composed upon the arrival of Charles in Scotland,
which so speedily followed the execution of Montrose, that the king
entered the city while the head of his most faithful and most successful
adherent was still blackening in the sun.</p>

<p>THE GALLANT GRAHAMS.</p>


<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now, fare thee weel, sweet Ennerdale!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Baith kith and countrie I bid adieu;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For I maun away, and I may not stay,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To some uncouth land which I never knew.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To wear the blue I think it best,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of all the colours that I see;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I'll wear it for the gallant Grahams,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That are banished from their countrie.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I have no gold, I have no land,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I have no pearl, nor precious stane;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But I wald sell my silken snood,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To see the gallant Grahams come hame.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In Wallace days when they began,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sir John the Graham did bear the gree,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through all the lands of Scotland wide;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He was a lord of the south countrie.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And so was seen full many a time;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For the summer flowers did never spring,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But every Graham, in armour bright,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Would then appear before the king.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They all were dressed in armour sheen,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Upon the pleasant banks of Tay;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Before a king they might be seen,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">These gallant Grahams in their array.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At the Goukhead our camp we set,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Our leaguer down there for to lay;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, in the bonnie summer light,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We rode our white horse and our gray.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our false commander sold our king</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Unto his deadly enemie,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who was the traitor Cromwell, then;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So I care not what they do with me.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They have betrayed our noble prince,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And banish'd him from his royal crown;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the gallant Grahams have ta'en in hand,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For to command those traitors down.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In Glen-Prosen<a name="FNanchor_A_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_13"><sup>[A]</sup></a> we rendezvoused,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">March'd to Glenshie by night and day,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And took the town of Aberdeen,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And met the Campbells in their array.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Five thousand men, in armour strong.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Did meet the gallant Grahams that day</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At Inverlochie, where war began,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And scarce two thousand men were they.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gallant Montrose, that chieftain bold,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Courageous in the best degree,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Did for the king fight well that day;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The lord preserve his majestie!</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nathaniel Gordon, stout and bold,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Did for king Charles wear the blue;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the cavaliers they all were sold,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And brave Harthill, a cavalier too.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Newton Gordon, burd-alone</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And Dalgatie, both stout and keen,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And gallant Veitch upon the field,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A braver face was never seen.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now, fare ye weel, sweet Ennerdale!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Countrie and kin I quit ye free;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Chear up your hearts, brave cavaliers,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For the Grahams are gone to high Germany.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At the water of Carron he did begin,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And fought the battle to the end;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where there were killed, for our noble king,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Two thousand of our Danish men.</span><br>

a parallel, was no favourite in Scotland. There occurs the following
invective against him, in a MS. in the Advocates' Library. The humour
consists in the dialect of a Highlander, speaking English, and confusing
<i>Cromwell</i> with <i>Gramach,</i> ugly:</p>

<p>The following tradition, concerning Cromwell, is preserved by an
uncommonly direct line of traditional evidence; being narrated (as I am
informed) by the grandson of an eye-witness. When Cromwell, in 1650,
entered Glasgow, he attended divine service in the High Church; but the
presbyterian divine, who officiated, poured forth, with more zeal than
prudence, the vial of his indignation upon the person, principles, and
cause, of the independent general. One of Cromwell's officers rose,
and whispered his commander; who seemed to give him a short and stern
answer, and the sermon was concluded without interruption Among the
crowd, who were assembled to gaze at the general, as he came out of the
church, was a shoemaker, the son of one of James the sixth's Scottish
footmen. This man had been born and bred in England, but, after his
father's death, had settled in Glasgow. Cromwell eyed him among the
crowd, and immediately called him by his name&mdash;the man fled; but, at
Cromwell's command, one of his retinue followed him, and brought him
to the general's lodgings. A number of the inhabitants remained at the
door, waiting the end of this extraordinary scene. The shoemaker soon
came out, in high spirits, and, shewing some gold, declared, he was
going to drink Cromwell's health. Many attended him to hear the
particulars of his interview; among others, the grandfather of the
narrator. The shoemaker said, that he had been a playfellow of Cromwell
when they were both boys, their parents residing in the same street;
that he had fled, when the general first called to him, thinking he
might owe him some ill-will, on account of his father being in the
service of the royal family. He added, that Cromwell had been so very
kind and familiar with him, that he ventured to ask him, what the
officer had said to him in the church. &quot;He proposed,&quot; said Cromwell, &quot;to
pull forth the &quot;minister by the ears; and I answered, that the preacher
was &quot;one fool, and he another.&quot; In the course of the day, Cromwell held
an interview with the minister, and contrived to satisfy his scruples so
effectually, that the evening discourse, by the same man, was tuned to
the praise and glory of the victor of Naseby.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Nathaniel Gordon, stout and bold,</i></span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Did for King Charles wear the, blue.</i>&mdash;P. 40. v. 5.</span><br>

<p>This gentleman was of the ancient family of Gordon of Gight. He had
served, as a soldier, upon the continent, and acquired great military
skill. When his chief, the marquis of Huntly, took up arms in 1640,
Nathaniel Gordon, then called Major Gordon, joined him, and was of
essential service during that short insurrection. But, being checked
for making prize of a Danish fishing buss, he left the service of the
marquis, in some disgust. In 1644, he assisted at a sharp and dexterous
<i>camisade</i> (as it was then called), when the barons of Haddo, of Gight,
of Drum, and other gentlemen, with only sixty men under their standard,
galloped through the old town of Aberdeen, and, entering the burgh
itself, about seven in the morning, made prisoners, and carried off,
four of the covenanting magistrates and effected a safe retreat, though
the town was then under the domination of the opposite party. After the
death of the baron of Haddo, and the severe treatment of Sir George
Gordon of Gight, his cousin-german, Major Nathaniel Gordon seems to have
taken arms, in despair of finding mercy at the covenanters' hands. On
the 24th of July, 1645, he came down, with a band of horsemen, upon the
town of Elgin, while St James' fair was held, and pillaged the merchants
of 14,000 merks of money and merchandize.<a name="FNanchor_A_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_14"><sup>[A]</sup></a> He seems to have joined
Montrose, as soon as he raised the royal standard; and, as a bold and
active partizan, rendered him great service. But, in November 1644,
Gordon, now a colonel, suddenly deserted Montrose, aided the escape of
Forbes of Craigievar, one of his prisoners, and reconciled himself to
the kirk, by doing penance for adultery, and for the almost equally
heinous crime of having scared Mr Andrew Cant,<a name="FNanchor_B_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_15"><sup>[B]</sup></a> the famous apostle of
the covenant. This, however, seems to have been an artifice, to arrange
a correspondence betwixt Montrose and Lord Gordon, a gallant young
nobleman, representative of the Huntley family, and inheriting their
loyal spirit, though hitherto engaged in the service of the covenant.
Colonel Gordon was successful, and returned to the royal camp with his
converted chief. Both followed zealously the fortunes of Montrose, until
Lord Gordon fell in the battle of Alford, and Nathaniel Gordon was taken
at Philiphaugh. He was one of ten loyalists, devoted upon that occasion,
by the parliament, to expiate, with their blood, the crime of fidelity
to their king. Nevertheless, the covenanted nobles would have probably
been satisfied with the death of the gallant Rollock, sharer of
Montrose's dangers and glory, of Ogilvy, a youth of eighteen, whose
crime was the hereditary feud betwixt his family and Argyle, and of Sir
Philip Nisbet, a cavalier of the ancient stamp, had not the pulpits
resounded with the cry, that God required the blood of the malignants,
to expiate the sins of the people. &quot;What meaneth,&quot; exclaimed the
ministers, in the perverted language of scripture&mdash;&quot;What meaneth, then,
this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen?&quot; The
appeal to the judgment of Samuel was decisive, and the shambles were
instantly opened. Nathaniel Gordon was brought first to execution. He
lamented the sins of his youth, once more (and probably with greater
sincerity) requested absolution from the sentence of excommunication
pronounced on account of adultery, and was beheaded 6th January 1646.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>And brave Harthill, a cavalier too.</i>&mdash;P. 40, v. 5.</span><br>

<p>Leith, of Harthill, was a determined loyalist, and hated the
covenanters, not without reason. His father, a haughty high-spirited
baron, and chief of a clan, happened, in 1639, to sit down in the desk
of provost Lesly, in the high kirk of Aberdeen He was disgracefully
thrust out by the officers, and, using some threatening language to the
provost, was imprisoned, like a felon, for many months, till he became
furious, and nearly mad. Having got free of the shackles, with which he
was loaded, he used his liberty by coming to the tolbooth window where
he uttered the most violent and horrible threats against Provost Lesly,
and the other covenanting magistrates, by whom he had been so severely
treated. Under pretence of this new offence, he was sent to Edinburgh,
and lay long in prison there; for, so fierce was his temper, that no one
would give surety for his keeping the peace with his enemies, if set at
liberty. At length he was delivered by Montrose, when he made himself
master of Edinburgh.&mdash;SPALDING, Vol. I. pp. 201; 266. His house of
Harthill was dismantled, and miserably pillaged by Forbes of
Craigievar, who expelled his wife and children with the most relentless
inhumanity.&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i> Vol. II. p. 225. Meanwhile, young Harthill was the
companion and associate of Nathaniel Gordon, whom he accompanied at
plundering the fair of Elgin, and at most of Montrose's engagements. He
retaliated severely on the covenanters, by ravaging and burning their
lands. <i>Ibid.</i> Vol. II. p. 301. His fate has escaped my notice.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>And Dalgatie, both stout and keen.</i>&mdash;P. 41. v. 1.</span><br>

<p>Sir Francis Hay, of Dalgatie, a steady cavalier, and a gentleman of
great gallantry and accomplishment. He was a faithful follower of
Montrose, and was taken prisoner with him at his last fatal battle. He
was condemned to death, with his illustrious general. Being a Roman
catholic, he refused the assistance of the presbyterian clergy, and was
not permitted, even on the scaffold, to receive ghostly comfort, in the
only form in which his religion taught him to consider it as effectual.
He kissed the axe, avowed his fidelity to his sovereign, and died like a
soldier.&mdash;<i>Montrose's Memoirs,</i> p. 322.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>And Newton Gordon, burd-alone.</i>&mdash;P. 41. v. 1.</span><br>

<p>Newton, for obvious reasons, was a common appellation of an estate, or
barony, where a new edifice had been erected. Hence, for distinction's
sake, it was anciently compounded with the name of the proprietor;
as, Newtown-Edmonstone, Newtown-Don, Newtown-Gordon, &amp;c. Of Gordon
of Newtown, I only observe, that he was, like all his clan, a steady
loyalist, and a follower of Montrose.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>And gallant Veitch, upon the field.</i>&mdash;P. 41. v. 1.</span><br>

<p>I presume this gentleman to have been David Veitch, brother to Veitch of
Dawick, who, with many other of the Peebles-shire gentry, was taken
at Philiphaugh. The following curious accident took place, some years
afterwards, in consequence of his loyal zeal.</p>

<p>&quot;In the year 1653, when the loyal party did arise in arms against the
English, in the North and West Highlands, some noblemen and loyal
gentlemen, with others, were forward to repair to them, with such forces
as they could make; which the English, with marvelouse diligence, night
and day, did bestir themselves to impede; making their troops of horse
and dragoons to pursue the loyal party in all places, that they might
not come to such a considerable number as was designed. It happened, one
night, that one Captain Masoun, commander of a troop of dragoons, that
came from Carlisle, in England, marching through the town of Sanquhar,
in the night, was encountered by one captain Palmer, commanding a troop
of horse, that came from Ayr, marching eastward; and, meeting at the
tollhouse, or tolbooth, one David Veitch, brother to the laird of
Dawick, in Tweeddale, and one of the loyal party, being prisoner in
irons by the English, did arise, and came to the window at their
meeting, and cryed out, that they should <i>fight valiantly for King
Charles</i>, Where-through, they, taking each other for the loyal party,
did begin a brisk fight, which continued for a while, til the dragoons,
having spent their shot, and finding the horsemen to be too strong for
them, did give ground; but yet retired, in some order, towards the
castle of Sanquhar, being hotly pursued by the troop, through the whole
town, above a quarter of a mile, till they came to the castle; where
both parties did, to their mutual grief, become sensible of their
mistake. In this skirmish there were several killed on both sides, and
Captain Palmer himself dangerously wounded, with many mo wounded in each
troop, who did peaceably dwell together afterward for a time, untill
their wounds were cured, in Sanquhar castle.&quot;&mdash;<i>Account of Presbytery of
Penpont, in Macfarlane's MSS.</i></p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>And bold Aboyne is to the sea,</i></span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Young Huntly is his noble name.</i>&mdash;P. 41. v. 3.</span><br>

<p>James, earl of Aboyne, who fled to France, and there died heart-broken.
It is said, his death was accelerated by the news of King Charles'
execution. He became representative of the Gordon family, or <i>Young
Huntly</i>, as the ballad expresses it, in consequence of the death of his
elder brother, George, who fell in the battle of Alford.&mdash;<i>History of

<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>By whom the king's banner was borne.</i>&mdash;P. 42. v. 1.</span><br>

<p>Gilbert Menzies, younger of Pitfoddells, carried the royal banner in
Montrose's last battle. It bore the headless corpse of Charles I., with
this motto, <i>&quot;Judge and revenge my cause, O Lord!&quot;</i> Menzies proved
himself worthy of this noble trust, and, obstinately refusing quarter,
died in defence of his charge. <i>Montrose's Memoirs</i>.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Hacket, an officer in the service of the estates.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>And Huntly's gone, the selfsame way.</i>&mdash;P. 42. v. 4.</span><br>

<p>George Gordon, second marquis of Huntley, one of the very few nobles in
Scotland, who had uniformly adhered to the king from the very beginning
of the troubles, was beheaded by the sentence of the parliament of
Scotland (so calling themselves), upon the 22d March, 1649, one month
and twenty-two days after the martyrdom of his master. He has been much
blamed for not cordially co-operating with Montrose; and Bishop Wishart,
in the zeal of partiality for his hero, accuses Huntley of direct
treachery. But he is a true believer, who seals, with his blood, his
creed, religious or political; and there are many reasons, short of this
foul charge, which may have dictated the backward conduct of Huntley
towards Montrose. He could not forget, that, when he first stood out for
the king, Montrose, then the soldier of the covenant, had actually made
him prisoner: and we cannot suppose Huntley to have been so sensible of
Montrose's superior military talents, as not to think himself, as equal
in rank, superior in power, and more uniform in loyalty entitled to
equally high marks of royal trust and favour. This much is certain, that
the gallant clan of Gordon contributed greatly to Montrose's success;
for the gentlemen of that name, with the brave and loyal Ogilvies,
composed the principal part of his cavalry.</p>

<br>

<p>THE BATTLE OF PENTLAND HILLS.</p>
<br>

<p>We have observed the early antipathy, mutually entertained by the
Scottish presbyterians and the house of Stuart It seems to have glowed
in the breast even of the good-natured Charles II. He might have
remembered, that, in 1551, the presbyterians had fought, bled, and
ruined themselves in his cause. But he rather recollected their early
faults than their late repentance; and even their services were combined
with the recollection of the absurd and humiliating circumstances of
personal degradation,<a name="FNanchor_A_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_16"><sup>[A]</sup></a> to which their pride and folly had subjected
him, while they professed to espouse his cause. As a man of pleasure, he
hated their stern and inflexible rigour, which stigmatised follies
even more deeply than crimes; and he whispered to his confidents, that
&quot;presbytery was no religion for a gentleman.&quot; It is not, therefore,
wonderful, that, in the first year of his restoration, he formally
reestablished prelacy in Scotland; but it is surprising, that, with his
father's example before his eyes, he should not have been satisfied
to leave at freedom the consciences of those who could not reconcile
themselves to the new system. The religious opinions of sectaries have a
tendency like the water of some springs, to become soft and mild, when
freely exposed to the open day. Who can recognise in the decent and
industrious quakers, and ana-baptists the wild and ferocious tenets
which distinguished their sects, while they were yet honoured with the
distinction of the scourge and the pillory? Had the system of coercion
against the presbyterians been continued until our day, Blair and
Robertson would have preached in the wilderness, and only discovered
their powers of eloquence and composition, by rolling along a deeper
torrent of gloomy fanaticism.</p>

<a name="Footnote_A_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_16">[A]</a><div class="note"><p> Among other ridiculous occurrences, it is said, that some
of Charles's gallantries were discovered by a prying neighbour. A wily
old minister was deputed, by his brethren, to rebuke the king for this
heinous scandal. Being introduced into the royal presence he limited
his commission to a serious admonition, that, upon such occasions,
his majesty should always shut the windows.&mdash;The king is said to have
recompensed this unexpected lenity after the Restoration. He probably
remembered the joke, though he might have forgotten the service.</p></div>

<p>The western counties distinguished themselves by their opposition to the
prelatic system. Three hundred and fifty ministers, ejected from their
churches and livings, wandered through the mountains, sowing the seeds
of covenanted doctrine, while multitudes of fanatical followers pursued
them, to reap the forbidden crop. These conventicles as they were
called, were denounced by the law, and their frequenters dispersed by
military force. The genius of the persecuted became stubborn, obstinate,
and ferocious; and, although indulgencies were tardily granted to some
presbyterian ministers, few of the true covenanters or whigs, as they
were called, would condescend to compound with a prelatic government, or
to listen even to their own favourite doctrine under the auspices of the
king. From Richard Cameron, their apostle, this rigid sect acquired the
name of Cameronians. They preached and prayed against the indulgence,
and against the presbyterians who availed themselves of it, because
their accepting this royal boon was a tacit acknowledgment of the king's
supremacy in ecclesiastical matters. Upon these bigotted and persecuted
fanatics, and by no means upon the presbyterians at large, are to
be charged the wild anarchical principles of anti-monarchy and
assassination which polluted the period when they flourished.</p>

<p>The insurrection, commemorated and magnified in the following ballad, as
indeed it has been in some histories, was, in itself, no very important
affair. It began in Dumfries-shire where Sir James Turner, a soldier
of fortune, was employed to levy the arbitrary fines imposed for not
attending the episcopal churches. The people rose, seized his person,
disarmed his soldiers, and having continued together, resolved to march
towards Edinburgh, expecting to be joined by their friends in that
quarter. In this they were disappointed; and, being now diminished to
half their numbers, they drew up on the Pentland Hills, at a place
called Rullien Green. They were commanded by one Wallace; and here they
awaited the approach of General Dalziel, of Binns; who, having marched
to Calder, to meet them on the Lanark road, and finding, that, by
passing through Collington, they had got to the other side of the hills,
cut through the mountains, and approached them. Wallace shewed both
spirit and judgment: he drew his men up in a very strong situation, and
withstood two charges of Dalziel's cavalry; but, upon the third shock,
the insurgents were broken, and utterly dispersed. There was very little
slaughter, as the cavalry of Dalziel were chiefly gentlemen, who pitied
their oppressed and misguided countrymen. There were about fifty killed,
and as many made prisoners. The battle was fought on the 28th November,
1666; a day still observed by the scattered remnant of the Cameronian
sect, who regularly hear a field-preaching upon the field of battle.</p>

<p>THE BATTLE OF LOUDONHILL.</p>
<br>

<p>The whigs, now become desperate, adopted the most desperate principles;
and retaliating, as far as they could, the intolerating persecution
which they endured, they openly disclaimed allegiance to any monarch
who should not profess presbytery, and subscribe the covenant.&mdash;These
principles were not likely to conciliate the favour of government; and
as we wade onward in the history of the times, the scenes become yet
darker. At length, one would imagine the parties had agreed to divide
the kingdom of vice betwixt them; the hunters assuming to themselves
open profligacy and legalized oppression; and the hunted, the opposite
attributes of hypocrisy, fanaticism, disloyalty, and midnight
assassination. The troopers and cavaliers became enthusiasts in the
pursuit of the covenanters If Messrs Kid, King, Cameron, Peden, &amp;c.
boasted of prophetic powers, and were often warned of the approach of
the soldiers, by supernatural impulse,<a name="FNanchor_A_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_17"><sup>[A]</sup></a> captain John Creichton, on
the other side, dreamed dreams, and saw visions (chiefly, indeed, after
having drunk hard), in which the lurking holes of the rebels were
discovered to his imagination.<a name="FNanchor_B_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_18"><sup>[B]</sup></a> Our ears are scarcely more shocked
with the profane execrations of the persecutors,<a name="FNanchor_C_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_19"><sup>[C]</sup></a> than with the
strange and insolent familiarity used towards the Deity by the
persecuted fanatics. Their indecent modes of prayer, their extravagant
expectations of miraculous assistance, and their supposed inspirations,
might easily furnish out a tale, at which the good would sigh, and the
gay would laugh.</p>

about ten o'clock at night, sitting at the fire-side, started up to his

yourself! for colonel&mdash;&mdash;is coming to this house to apprehend you; and
I advise you all to do the like, for he will be here within an hour;&quot;
which came to pass: and when they had made a very narrow search, within
and without the house, and went round the thorn-bush, under which he was
lying praying, they went off without their prey. He came in, and said,
&quot;And has this gentleman (designed by his name) given poor Sandie, and
thir poor things, such a fright? For this night's work, God shall give
him such a blow, within a few days, that all the physicians on earth
shall not be able to cure;&quot; which came to pass, for he died in great

<p>The militia and standing army soon became unequal to the task of
enforcing conformity, and suppressing conventicles In, their aid, and to
force compliance with a test proposed by government, the Highland
clans were raised, and poured down into Ayrshire.<a name="FNanchor_A_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_20"><sup>[A]</sup></a> An armed host
of undisciplined mountaineers, speaking a different language, and
professing, many of them, another religion, were let loose, to ravage
and plunder this unfortunate country; and it is truly astonishing to
find how few acts of cruelty they perpetrated, and how seldom they added
murder to pillage<a name="FNanchor_B_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_21"><sup>[B]</sup></a> Additional levies of horse were also raised, under
the name of Independent Troops, and great part of them placed under the
command of James Grahame of Claverhouse a man well known to fame, by
his subsequent title of viscount Dundee, but better remembered, in the
western shires, under the designation of the bloody Clavers. In truth,
he appears to have combined the virtues and vices of a savage chief.
Fierce, unbending, and rigorous, no emotion of compassion prevented his
commanding, and witnessing, every detail of military execution against
the non-conformists. Undauntedly brave, and steadily faithful to his
prince, he sacrificed himself in the cause of James, when he was
deserted by all the world. If we add, to these attributes, a goodly
person, complete skill in martial exercises, and that ready and decisive
character, so essential to a commander, we may form some idea of this
extraordinary character. The whigs, whom he persecuted daunted by his
ferocity and courage, conceived him to be impassive to their bullets,<a name="FNanchor_C_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_22"><sup>[C]</sup></a>
and that he had sold himself, for temporal greatness, to the
seducer of mankind. It is still believed, that a cup of wine,
presented to him by his butler, changed into clotted blood; and
that, when he plunged his feet into cold water, their touch
caused it to boil. The steed, which bore him, was supposed
to be the gift of Satan; and precipices are shewn, where a fox could
hardly keep his feet, down which the infernal charger conveyed him
safely, in pursuit of the wanderers. It is remembered, with terror, that
Claverhouse was successful in every engagement with the whigs, except
that at Drumclog, or Loudon-hill, which is the subject of the following
ballad. The history of Burly, the hero of the piece, will bring us
immediately to the causes and circumstances of that event.</p>

<a name="Footnote_C_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_C_22">[C]</a><div class="note"><p> It was, and is believed, that the devil furnished his
favourites, among the persecutors, with what is called <i>proof</i>
against leaden bullets, but against those only. During the battle of
Pentland-hills Paton of Meadowhead conceived he saw the balls hop
harmlessly down from General Dalziel's boots, and, to counteract the
spell, loaded his pistol with a piece of silver coin. But Dalziel,
having his eye on him, drew back behind his servant, who was shot
dead.&mdash;<i>Paton's Life.</i> At a skirmish, in Ayrshire, some of the wanderers
defended themselves in a sequestered house, by the side of a lake. They
aimed repeatedly, but in vain, at the commander of the assailants, an
English officer, until, their ammunition running short, one of them
loaded his piece with the ball at the head of the tongs, and succeeded
in shooting the hitherto impenetrable captain. To accommodate Dundee's
fate to their own hypothesis, the Cameronian tradition runs, that, in
the battle of Killicrankie, he fell, not by the enemy's fire, but by the
pistol of one of his own servants, who, to avoid the spell, had loaded
it with a silver button from his coat. One of their writers argues thus:
&quot;Perhaps, some may think this, anent proof-shot, a paradox, and be ready
to object here, as formerly concerning Bishop Sharpe and Dalziel&mdash;How
can the devil have, or give, power to save life? Without entering upon
the thing in its reality, I shall only observe, 1. That it is neither
in his power, or of his nature, to be a saviour of men's lives; he is
called Apollyon, the destroyer. 2. That, even in this case, he is said
only to give enchantment against one kind of metal, and this does not
save life: for, though lead could not take Sharpe and Claverhouse's
lives, yet steel and silver could do it; and, for Dalziel, though
he died not on the field, yet he did not escape the arrows of the
Almighty.&quot;&mdash;<i>God's Judgement against Persecutors.</i> If the reader be not
now convinced of <i>the thing in its reality</i>, I have nothing to add to

<p>John Balfour of Kinloch, commonly called Burly, was one of the fiercest
of the proscribed sect. A gentleman by birth, he was, says his
biographer, &quot;zealous and honest-hearted, courageous in every enterprise,
and a brave soldier, seldom any escaping that came in his hands.&quot; <i>Life
of John Balfour.</i> Creichton says, that he was once chamberlain to
Archbishop Sharpe, and, by negligence, or dishonesty, had incurred
a large arrear, which occasioned his being active in his master's
assassination. But of this I know no other evidence than Creichton's
assertion, and a hint in Wodrow. Burly, for that is his most common
designation, was brother-in-law to Hackston of Rathillet a wild
enthusiastic character, who joined daring courage, and skill in the
sword, to the fiery zeal of his sect. Burly, himself, was less eminent
for religious fervour than for the active and violent share which he had
in the most desperate enterprises of his party. His name does not appear
among the covenanters, who were denounced for the affair of Pentland.
But, in 1677, Robert Hamilton, afterwards commander of the insurgents at
Loudon Hill, and Bothwell Bridge, with several other non-conformists,
were assembled at this Burly's house, in Fife. There they were attacked
by a party of soldiers, commanded by Captain Carstairs, whom they beat
off, wounding desperately one of his party. For this resistance to
authority, they were declared rebels. The next exploit, in which Burly
was engaged, was of a bloodier complexion, and more dreadful celebrity.
It is well known, that James Sharpe, archbishop of St Andrews, was
regarded, by the rigid presbyterians, not only as a renegade, who had
turned back from the spiritual plough, but as the principal author of
the rigours exercised against their sect. He employed, as an agent of
his oppression, one Carmichael, a decayed gentleman. The industry
of this man, in procuring information, and in enforcing the severe
penalties against conventiclers, having excited the resentment of
the Cameronians, nine of their number, of whom Burly, and his
brother-in-law, Hackston, were the leaders, assembled, with the purpose
of way-laying and murdering Carmichael; but, while they searched for him
in vain, they received tidings that the archbishop himself was at hand.
The party resorted to prayer; after which, they agreed, unanimously,
that the Lord had delivered the wicked Haman into their hand. In the
execution of the supposed will of heaven, they agreed to put themselves
under the command of a leader; and they requested Hackston of Rathillet
to accept the office, which he declined alleging, that, should he comply
with their request, the slaughter might be imputed to a private quarrel,
which existed betwixt him and the archbishop. The command was then
offered to Burly, who accepted it without scruple; and they galloped off
in pursuit of the archbishop's carriage, which contained himself and
his daughter. Being well mounted, they easily overtook and disarmed the
prelate's attendants. Burly, crying out, &quot;Judas, be taken!&quot; rode up to
the carriage, wounded the postillion and ham-strung one of the horses.
He then fired into the coach a piece, charged with several bullets, so
near, that the archbishop's gown was set on fire. The rest, coming up,
dismounted, and dragged him out of the carriage, when, frightened and
wounded, he crawled towards Hackston, who still remained on horseback,
and begged for mercy. The stern enthusiast contented himself with
answering, that he would not himself <i>lay a hand on him</i>. Burly and his
men again fired a volley upon the kneeling old man; and were in the act
of riding off, when one, who remained to girth his horse, unfortunately
heard the daughter of their victim call to the servant for help,
exclaiming, that his master was still alive. Burly then again
dismounted, struck off the prelate's hat with his foot, and split his
skull with his shable (broad sword), although one of the party (probably
Rathillet) exclaimed, &quot;<i>Spare these grey hairs</i>!&quot;<a name="FNanchor_A_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_23"><sup>[A]</sup></a> The rest pierced
him with repeated wounds. They plundered the carriage, and rode off,
leaving, beside the mangled corpse, the daughter, who was herself
wounded, in her pious endeavour to interpose betwixt her father and his
murderers. The murder is accurately represented, in bas-relief, upon a
beautiful monument erected to the memory of Archbishop Sharpe, in the
metropolitan church of St Andrews. This memorable example of fanatic
revenge was acted upon Magus Muir, near St Andrews, 3d May, 1679.<a name="FNanchor_B_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_24"><sup>[B]</sup></a></p>

<a name="Footnote_A_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_23">[A]</a><div class="note"><p> They believed Sharpe to be proof against shot; for one of
the murderers told Wodrow, that, at the sight of cold iron, his courage
fell. They no longer doubted this, when they found in his pocket a small
clue of silk, rolled round a bit of parchment, marked with two long
words, in Hebrew or Chaldaic characters. Accordingly, it is still
averred, that the balls only left blue marks on the prelate's neck and
breast, although the discharge was so near as to burn his clothes.</p></div>

<a name="Footnote_B_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_24">[B]</a><div class="note"><p> The question, whether the bishop of St Andrews' death was
murder was a shibboleth, or <i>experimentum crucis</i>, frequently put to the
apprehended conventiclers. Isabel Alison, executed at Edinburgh, 26th
January, 1681, was interrogated, before the privy council, if she
conversed with David Hackston? &quot;I answered, I did converse with him, and
I bless the Lord that ever I saw him; for I never saw ought in him but
a godly pious youth. They asked, if the killing of the bishop of St
Andrews was a pious act? I answered, I never heard him say he killed
him; but, if God moved any, and put it upon them, to execute his
righteous judgment upon him, I have nothing to say to that. They asked
me, when saw ye John Balfour (Burly), that pious youth? I answered,
I have seen him. They asked, when? I answered, these are frivolous
questions; I am not bound to answer them.&quot; <i>Cloud of Witnesses</i>, p. 85.</p></div>

<p>Burly was, of course, obliged to leave Fife; and, upon the 25th of the
same month, he arrived in Evandale, in Lanarkshire, along with Hackston,
and a fellow, called Dingwall, or Daniel, one of the same bloody band.
Here he joined his old friend Hamilton, already mentioned; and, as they
resolved to take up arms, they were soon at the head of such a body of
the &quot;chased and tossed western men,&quot; as they thought equal to keep the
field. They resolved to commence their exploits upon the 29th of May,
1679, being the anniversary of the Restoration, appointed to be kept as
a holiday, by act of parliament; an institution which they esteemed a
presumptuous and unholy solemnity. Accordingly, at the head of eighty
horse, tolerably appointed, Hamilton, Burly, and Hackston, entered the
royal burgh of Rutherglen, extinguished the bonfires, made in honour
of the day; burned at the cross the acts of parliament in favour of
prelacy, and for suppression of conventicles, as well as those acts
of council, which regulated the indulgence granted to presbyterians.
Against all these acts they entered their solemn protest, or testimony,
as they called it; and, having affixed it to the cross, concluded with
prayer and psalms. Being now joined by a large body of foot, so that
their strength seems to have amounted to five or six hundred men, though
very indifferently armed, they encamped upon Loudoun Hill. Claverhouse,
who was in garrison at Glasgow, instantly marched against the
insurgents, at the head of his own troop of cavalry and others,
amounting to about one hundred and fifty men. He arrived at Hamilton,
on the 1st of June, so unexpectedly, as to make prisoner John King, a
famous preacher among the wanderers; and rapidly continued his march,
carrying his captive along with him, till he came to the village of
Drumclog, about a mile east of Loudoun Hill, and twelve miles south-west
of Hamilton. At some distance from this place, the insurgents were
skilfully posted in a boggy strait, almost inaccessible to cavalry,
having a broad ditch in their front. Claverhouse's dragoons discharged
their carabines, and made an attempt to charge; but the nature of the
ground threw them into total disorder. Burly, who commanded the handful
of horse belonging to the whigs, instantly led them down on the
disordered squadrons of Claverhouse, who were, at the same time,
vigorously assaulted by the foot, headed by the gallant Cleland,<a name="FNanchor_A_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_25"><sup>[A]</sup></a> and
the enthusiastic Hackston. Claverhouse himself was forced to fly, and
was in the utmost danger of being taken; his horse's belly being cut
open by the stroke of a scythe, so that the poor animal trailed his
bowels for more than a mile. In his flight, he passed King, the
minister, lately his prisoner, but now deserted by his guard, in the
general confusion. The preacher hollowed to the flying commander, &quot;to
halt, and take his prisoner with him;&quot; or, as others say, &quot;to stay,
and take the afternoon's preaching.&quot; Claverhouse, at length remounted,
continued his retreat to Glasgow. He lost, in the skirmish, about twenty
of his troopers, and his own cornet and kinsman, Robert Graham, whose
fate is alluded to in the ballad. Only four of the other side were
killed, among whom was Dingwall, or Daniel, an associate of Burly in
Sharpe's murder. &quot;The rebels,&quot; says Creichton, &quot;finding the cornet's
body, and supposing it to be that of Clavers, because the name of Graham
was wrought in the shirt-neck, treated it with the utmost inhumanity;
cutting off the nose, picking out the eyes, and stabbing it through in
a hundred places.&quot; The same charge is brought by Guild, in his <i>Bellum
Bothuellianum</i>, in which occurs the following account of the skirmish at
Drumclog:&mdash;</p>

<a name="Footnote_A_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_25">[A]</a><div class="note"><p> William Cleland, a man of considerable genius, was author
of several poems, published in 1697. His Hudibrastic verses are poor
scurrilous trash, as the reader may judge from the description of the
Highlanders, already quoted. But, in a wild rhapsody, entitled, &quot;Hollo,

seem to break out in the following lines:&mdash;

He was a strict non-conformist, and, after the Revolution, became
lieutenant colonel of the earl of Angus's regiment, called the
Cameronian regiment. He was killed 21st August, 1689, in the churchyard
of Dunkeld, which his corps manfully and successfully defended against
a superior body of Highlanders. His son was the author of the letter
prefixed to the Dunciad, and is said to have been the notorious Cleland,
who, in circumstances of pecuniary embarrassment, prostituted his
talents to the composition of indecent and infamous works; but this
seems inconsistent with dates, and the latter personage was probably the
grandson of Colonel Cleland.</p></div>

<p>Although Burly was among the most active leaders in the action, he was
not the commander in chief, as one would conceive from the ballad. That
honour belonged to Robert Hamilton, brother to Sir William Hamilton of
Preston, a gentleman, who, like most of those at Drumclog, had imbibed
the very wildest principles of fanaticism. The Cameronian account of
the insurrection states, that &quot;Mr Hamilton discovered a great deal of
bravery and valour, both in the conflict with, and pursuit of the enemy;
but when he and some others were pursuing the enemy, others flew too
greedily upon the spoil, small as it was, instead of pursuing the
victory: and some, without Mr Hamilton's knowledge, and against his
strict command, gave five of these bloody enemies quarters, and then let
them go: this greatly grieved Mr Hamilton, when he saw some of Babel's
brats spared, after the Lord had delivered them to their hands, that
they might dash them against the stones.&quot; <i>Psalm</i> cxxxvii. 9. In his own
account of this, &quot;he reckons the sparing of these enemies, and letting
them go, to be among their first stepping aside; for which, he feared
that the Lord would not honour them to do much more for him; and says,
that he was neither for taking favours from, nor giving favours to the
Lord's enemies.&quot; Burly was not a likely man to fall into this sort of
backsliding. He disarmed one of the duke of Hamilton's servants, who had
been in the action, and desired him to tell his master, he would keep,
till meeting, the pistols he had taken from him. The man described Burly
to the duke as a little stout man, squint-eyed, and of a most ferocious
aspect; from which it appears, that Burly's figure corresponded to his
manners, and perhaps gave rise to his nickname, <i>Burly</i> signifying
<i>strong</i>. He was with the insurgents till the battle of Bothwell Bridge,
and afterwards fled to Holland. He joined the prince of Orange, but died
at sea, during the expedition. The Cameronians still believe, he
had obtained liberty from the prince to be avenged of those who had
persecuted the Lord's people; but through his death, the laudable design
of purging the land with their blood, is supposed to have fallen to the
ground.&mdash;<i>Life of Balfour of Kinloch.</i></p>

<br>

<p>THE BATTLE OF BOTHWELL-BRIDGE.</p>
<br>

<p>It has been often remarked, that the Scottish, notwithstanding their
national courage, were always unsuccessful, when fighting for their
religion. The cause lay, not in the principle, but in the mode of its
application. A leader like Mahomet, who is, at the same time, the
prophet of his tribe, may avail himself of religious enthusiasm, because
it comes to the aid of discipline, and is a powerful means of attaining
the despotic command, essential to the success of a general. But,
among the insurgents, in the reigns of the last Stuarts, were mingled
preachers, who taught different shades of the presbyterian doctrine;
and, minute as these shades sometimes were, neither the several
shepherds, nor their flocks, could cheerfully unite in a common cause.
This will appear from the transactions leading to the battle of Bothwell
Bridge.</p>

<p>We have seen, that the party, which defeated Claverhouse at Loudoun
Hill, were Cameronians, whose principles consisted in disowning all
temporal authority, which did not flow from and through the Solemn
League and Covenant. This doctrine, which is still retained by a
scattered remnant of the sect in Scotland, is in theory, and would be in
practice, inconsistent with the safety of any well regulated government,
because the Covenanters deny to their governors that toleration, which
was iniquitously refused to themselves. In many respects, therefore, we
cannot be surprised at the anxiety and rigour with which the Cameronians
were persecuted, although we may be of opinion, that milder means would
have induced a melioration of their principles. These men, as already
noticed, excepted against such presbyterians, as were contented to
exercise their worship under the indulgence granted by government,
or, in other words, who would have been satisfied with toleration for
themselves, without insisting upon a revolution in the state, or even in
the church government.</p>

<p>When, however, the success at Loudoun Hill was spread abroad, a number
of preachers, gentlemen, and common people, who had embraced the more
moderate doctrine, joined the army of Hamilton, thinking, that the
difference in their opinions ought not to prevent their acting in the
common cause. The insurgents were repulsed in an attack upon the town
of Glasgow, which, however, Claverhouse, shortly afterwards, thought it
necessary to evacuate. They were now nearly in full possession of the
west of Scotland, and pitched their camp at Hamilton, where, instead of
modelling and disciplining their army, the Cameronians and Erastians
(for so the violent insurgents chose to call the more moderate
presbyterians) only debated, in council of war, the real cause of their
being in arms. Hamilton, their general, was the leader of the first
party; Mr John Walsh, a minister, headed the Erastians. The latter so
far prevailed, as to get a declaration drawn up, in which they owned the
king's government; but the publication of it gave rise to new quarrels.
Each faction had its own set of leaders, all of whom aspired to be
officers; and there were actually two councils of war issuing contrary
orders and declarations at the same time; the one owning the king, and
the other designing him a malignant, bloody, and perjured tyrant.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, their numbers and zeal were magnified at Edinburgh, and great
alarm excited lest they should march eastward. Not only was the foot
militia instantly called out, but proclamations were issued, directing
all the heritors, in the eastern, southern, and northern shires, to
repair to the king's host, with their best horses, arms, and retainers.
In Fife, and other countries, where the presbyterian doctrines
prevailed, many gentlemen disobeyed this order, and were afterwards
severely fined. Most of them alleged, in excuse, the apprehension of
disquiet from their wives.<a name="FNanchor_A_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_26"><sup>[A]</sup></a> A respectable force was soon assembled;
and James, duke of Buccleuch and Monmouth, was sent down, by Charles,
to take the command, furnished with instructions, not unfavourable
to presbyterians. The royal army now moved slowly forwards towards
Hamilton, and reached Bothwell-moor on the 22d of June, 1679. The
insurgents were encamped chiefly in the duke of Hamilton's park, along
the Clyde, which separated the two armies. Bothwell-bridge, which is
long and narrow, had then a portal in the middle, with gates, which the
Covenanters shut, and barricadoed with stones and logs of timber. This
important post was defended by three hundred of their best men, under
Hackston of Rathillet, and Hall of Haughhead. Early in the morning, this
party crossed the bridge, and skirmished with the royal vanguard,
now advanced as far as the village of Bothwell. But Hackston speedily
retired to his post, at the western end of Bothwell-bridge.</p>

<a name="Footnote_A_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_26">[A]</a><div class="note"><p> &quot;Balcanquhall of that ilk alledged, that his horses were
robbed, but shunned to take the declaration, for fear of disquiet from
his wife. Young of Kirkton&mdash;his ladyes dangerous sickness, and bitter
curses if he should leave her, and the appearance of abortion on his
offering to go from her. And many others pled, in general terms, that
their wives opposed or contradicted their going. But the justiciary
court found this defence totally irrelevant.&quot;&mdash;Fountainhall's
<i>Decisions</i>, Vol. I. p. 88.</p></div>

<p>While the dispositions, made by the duke of Monmouth, announced his
purpose of assailing the pass, the more moderate of the insurgents
resolved to offer terms. Ferguson of Kaithloch, a gentleman of landed
fortune, and David Hume, a clergyman, carried to the duke of Monmouth
a supplication, demanding free exercise of their religion, a free
parliament, and a free general assembly of the church. The duke heard
their demands with his natural mildness, and assured them, he would
interpose with his majesty in their behalf, on condition of their
immediately dispersing themselves, and yielding up their arms. Had the
insurgents been all of the moderate opinion, this proposal would have
been accepted, much bloodshed saved, and, perhaps, some permanent
advantage derived to their party; or, had they been all Cameronians,
their defence would have been fierce and desperate. But, while their
motley and misassorted officers were debating upon the duke's proposal,
his field-pieces were already planted on the eastern side of the
river, to cover the attack of the foot guards, who were led on by Lord
Livingstone to force the bridge. Here Hackston maintained his post with
zeal and courage; nor was it until all his ammunition was expended, and
every support denied him by the general, that he reluctantly abandoned
the important pass.<a name="FNanchor_A_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_27"><sup>[A]</sup></a> When his party were drawn back, the duke's army,
slowly, and with their cannon in front, defiled along the bridge,
and formed in line of battle, as they came over the river; the duke
commanded the foot, and Claverhouse the cavalry. It would seem, that
these movements could not have been performed without at least some
loss, had the enemy been serious in opposing them. But the insurgents
were otherwise employed. With the strangest delusion, that ever fell
upon devoted beings, they chose these precious moments to cashier their
officers, and elect others in their room. In this important operation,
they were at length disturbed by the duke's cannon, at the very first
discharge of which, the horse of the Covenanters wheeled, and rode off,
breaking and trampling down the ranks of their infantry in their flight.
The Cameronian account blames Weir of Greenridge, a commander of the
horse, who is termed a sad Achan in the camp. The more moderate party
lay the whole blame on Hamilton, whose conduct, they say, left the world
to debate, whether he was most traitor, coward, or fool. The generous
Monmouth was anxious to spare the blood of his infatuated countrymen, by
which he incurred much blame among the high-flying royalists. Lucky it
was for the insurgents that the battle did not happen a day later, when
old General Dalziel, who divided with Claverhouse the terror and hatred
of the whigs, arrived in the camp, with a commission to supersede
Monmouth, as commander in chief. He is said to have upbraided the
duke, publicly, with his lenity, and heartily to have wished his own
commission had come a day sooner, when, as he expresses himself, &quot;These
rogues should never more have troubled the king or country.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_B_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_28"><sup>[B]</sup></a> But,
notwithstanding the merciful orders of the duke of Monmouth, the cavalry
made great slaughter among the fugitives, of whom four hundred were
slain. Guild thus expresses himself:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ei ni Dux validus tenuisset forte catervas,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Vix quisquam profugus vitam servasset inertem:</span><br>

<a name="Footnote_A_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_27">[A]</a><div class="note"><p> There is an accurate representation of this part of the
engagement in an old painting, of which there are two copies extant;
one in the collection of his grace the duke of Hamilton, the other at
Dalkeith house. The whole appearance of the ground, even including a few
old houses, is the same which the scene now presents: The removal of the
porch, or gateway, upon the bridge, is the only perceptible difference.
The duke of Monmouth, on a white charger, directs the march of the party
engaged in storming the bridge, while his artillery gall the motley
ranks of the Covenanters. An engraving of this painting would be
acceptable to the curious; and I am satisfied an opportunity of copying
it, for that purpose, would be readily granted by either of the noble
proprietors.</p></div>

<a name="Footnote_B_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_28">[B]</a><div class="note"><p> Dalziel was a man of savage manners. A prisoner having
railed at him, while under examination before the privy council, calling
him &quot;a Muscovia beast, who used to roast men, the general, in a passion,
struck him, with the pomel of his shabble, on the face, till the blood
sprung.&quot;&mdash;FOUNTAINHALL, Vol. I. p. 159. He had sworn never to shave his
beard after the death of Charles the First. This venerable appendage
reached his girdle, and, as he wore always an old-fashioned buff coat,
his appearance in London never failed to attract the notice of the
children and of the mob. King Charles II. used to swear at him, for
bringing such a rabble of boys together, to be squeezed to death, while
they gaped at his long beard and antique habit, and exhorted him to
shave and dress like a Christian, to keep the poor <i>bairns</i>, as Dalziel
expressed it, out of danger. In compliance with this request, he once
appeared at court fashionably dressed, excepting the beard; but, when
the king had laughed sufficiently at the metamorphosis, he
resumed his old dress, to the great joy of the boys, his usual
attendants.&mdash;CREICHTON'S <i>Memoirs</i>, p. 102.</p></div>

though more remote and less natural, than that in the ballad, which
imputes the severity of the pursuit to his thirst to revenge the death
of his cornet and kinsman, at Drumclog;<a name="FNanchor_A_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_29"><sup>[A]</sup></a> and to the quarrel betwixt
Claverhouse and Monmouth, it ascribes, with great <i>naivet&eacute;</i> the bloody
fate of the latter. Local tradition is always apt to trace foreign
events to the domestic causes, which are more immediately in the
narrator's view. There is said to be another song upon this battle, once
very popular, but I have not been able to recover it. This copy is given
from recitation.</p>

<a name="Footnote_A_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_29">[A]</a><div class="note"><p> There is some reason to conjecture, that the revenge of the
Cameronians, if successful, would have been little less sanguinary than
that of the royalists. Creichton mentions, that they had erected, in
their camp, a high pair of gallows, and prepared a quantity of halters,
to hang such prisoners as might fall into their hands, and he admires
the forbearance of the king's soldiers, who, when they returned with
their prisoners, brought them to the very spot where the gallows stood,
and guarded them there, without offering to hang a single individual.
Guild, in the <i>Bellum Bothuellianum</i>, alludes to the same story, which
is rendered probable by the character of Hamilton, the insurgent
general. GUILD'S <i>MSS.</i>&mdash;CREICHTON'S <i>Memoirs</i>, p. 61.</p></div>

<p>There were two Gordons of Earlstoun, father and son. They were descended
of an ancient family in the west of Scotland, and their progenitors were
believed to have been favourers of the reformed doctrine, and possessed
of a translation of the Bible, as early as the days of Wickliffe.
William Gordon, the father, was, in 1663, summoned before the privy
council, for keeping conventicles in his house and woods. By another act
of council, he was banished out of Scotland; but the sentence was never
put into execution. In 1667, Earlstoun was turned out of his house,
which was converted into a garrison for the king's soldiers. He was not
in the battle of Bothwell Bridge, but was met, hastening towards it, by
some English dragoons, engaged in the pursuit, already commenced. As
he refused to surrender, he was instantly slain. WILSON'S <i>History
of Bothwell Rising&mdash;Life of Gordon of Earlston, in Scottish
Worthies</i>&mdash;WODROW'S <i>History,</i> Vol. II. The son, Alexander Gordon
of Earlstoun, I suppose to be the hero of the ballad. He was not a
Cameronian, but of the more moderate class of presbyterians, whose sole
object was freedom of conscience, and relief from the oppressive laws
against non-conformists. He joined the insurgents, shortly after the
skirmish at Loudoun-hill. He appears to have been active in forwarding
the supplication sent to the duke of Monmouth. After the battle, he
escaped discovery, by flying into a house at Hamilton, belonging to one
of his tenants, and disguising himself in female attire. His person
was proscribed, and his estate of Earlstoun was bestowed upon Colonel
Theophilus Ogilthorpe, by the crown, first in security for L.5000,
and afterwards in perpetuity.&mdash;FOUNTAINHALL, p. 390. The same author
mentions a person tried at the circuit court, July 10, 1683, solely for
holding intercourse with Earlstoun, an intercommuned (proscribed) rebel.
As he had been in Holland after the battle of Bothwell, he was probably
accessory to the scheme of invasion, which the unfortunate earl of
Argyle was then meditating. He was apprehended upon his return to
Scotland, tried, convicted of treason, and condemned to die; but his
fate was postponed by a letter from the king, appointing him to be
reprieved for a month, that he might, in the interim, be tortured for
the discovery of his accomplices. The council had the unusual spirit
to remonstrate against this illegal course of severity. On November
3, 1653, he received a farther respite, in hopes he would make some
discovery. When brought to the bar, to be tortured (for the king had
reiterated his commands), he, through fear or distraction, roared like a
bull, and laid so stoutly about him, that the hangman and his assistant
could hardly master him. At last he fell into a swoon, and, on his
recovery, charged General Dalziel and Drummond (violent tories),
together with the duke of Hamilton, with being the leaders of the
fanatics. It was generally thought, that he affected this extravagant
behaviour, to invalidate all that agony might extort from him concerning
his real accomplices. He was sent, first, to Edinburgh castle, and,
afterwards, to a prison upon the Bass island; although the privy council
more than once deliberated upon appointing his immediate death. On 22d
August, 1684, Earlstoun was sent for from the Bass, and ordered for
execution, 4th November, 1684. He endeavoured to prevent his doom by
escape; but was discovered and taken, after he had gained the roof of
the prison. The council deliberated, whether, in consideration of this
attempt, he was not liable to instant execution. Finally, however, they
were satisfied to imprison him in Blackness castle, where he remained
till after the Revolution, when he was set at liberty, and his doom of
forfeiture reversed by act of parliament.&mdash;See FOUNTAINHALL, Vol. I. pp.

<p>NOTES ON THE BATTLE OF BOTHWELL-BRIDGE.</p>


<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Then he set up the flag of red,</i></span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>A' set about wi' bonnie blue.</i>&mdash;P. 91. v. 1.</span><br>

<p>Blue was the favourite colour of the Covenanters; hence the vulgar
phrase of a true blue whig. Spalding informs us, that when the first
army of Covenanters entered Aberdeen, few or none &quot;wanted a blue
ribband; the lord Gordon, and some others of the marquis (of Huntley's)
family had a ribband, when they were dwelling in the town, of a red
fresh colour, which they wore in their hats, and called it the <i>royal
ribband</i>, as a sign of their love and loyalty to the king. In despite
and derision thereof, this blue ribband was worn, and called the
<i>Covenanter's ribband</i>, by the hail soldiers of the army, who would not
hear of the royal ribband, such was their pride and malice.&quot;&mdash;Vol. I. p.
123. After the departure of this first army, the town was occupied by
the barons of the royal party, till they were once more expelled by the
Covenanters, who plundered the burgh and country adjacent; &quot;no fowl,
cock, or hen, left unkilled, the hail house-dogs, messens (i.e.
lap-dogs), and whelps, within Aberdeen, killed upon the streets; so that
neither hound, messen, nor other dog, was left alive that they could
see: the reason was this,&mdash;when the first army came here, ilk captain
and soldier had a blue ribband about his craig (i.e. neck); in despite
and derision whereof, when they removed from Aberdeen, some women of
Aberdeen, as was alleged, knit blue ribbands about their messens'
craigs, whereat their soldiers took offence, and killed all their dogs
for this very cause.&quot;&mdash;P. 160.</p>

<p>I have seen one of the ancient banners of the Covenanters: it
was divided into four copartments, inscribed with the words,
<i>Christ&mdash;Covenant&mdash;King&mdash;Kingdom</i>. Similar standards are mentioned in
Spalding's curious and minute narrative, Vol. II. pp. 182, 245.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Hold up your hand, ye cursed Graeme,</i></span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Else a rebel to our king ye'll be.</i>&mdash;P, 91. v. 5.</span><br>

<p>It is very extraordinary, that, in April, 1685, Claverhouse was left out
of the new commission of privy council, as being too favourable to the
fanatics. The pretence was his having married into the presbyterian
family of lord Dundonald. An act of council was also past, regulating
the payment of quarters, which is stated by Fountainhall to have been
done in <i>odium</i> of Claverhouse, and in order to excite complaints
against him. This charge, so inconsistent with the nature and conduct of
Claverhouse, seems to have been the fruit of a quarrel betwixt him and
the lord high treasurer. FOUNTAINHALL, Vol. I. p. 360.</p>

<p>That Claverhouse was most unworthily accused of mitigating the
persecution of the Covenanters, will appear from the following simple,
but very affecting narrative, extracted from one of the little
publications which appeared soon after the Revolution, while the
facts were fresh in the memory of the sufferers. The imitation of the
scriptural stile produces, in some passages of these works, an effect
not unlike what we feel in reading the beautiful book of Ruth. It is
taken from the life of Mr Alexander Peden,<a name="FNanchor_A_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_34"><sup>[A]</sup></a> printed about 1720.</p>

<p>&quot;In the beginning of May, 1685, he came to the house of John Brown and
Marion Weir, whom he married before he went to Ireland, where he stayed
all night; and, in the morning when he took farewell, he came out of the
door, saying to himself, &quot;Poor woman, a fearful morning,&quot; twice over. &quot;A
dark misty morning!&quot; The next morning, between five and six hours, the
said John Brown having performed the worship of God in his family, was
going, with a spade in his hand, to make ready some peat ground: the
mist being very dark, he knew not until cruel and bloody Claverhouse
compassed him with three troops of horse, brought him to his house, and
there examined him; who, though he was a man of a stammering speech, yet
answered him distinctly and solidly; which made Claverhouse to examine
those whom he had taken to be his guides through the muirs, if ever they
heard him preach? They answered, &quot;No, no, he was never a preacher.&quot; He
said, &quot;If he has never preached, meikle he has prayed in his time;&quot; he
said to John, &quot;Go to your prayers, for you shall immediately die!&quot; When
he was praying, Claverhouse interrupted him three times; one time, that
he stopt him, he was pleading that the Lord would spare a remnant, and
not make a full end in the day of his anger. Claverhouse said, &quot;I gave
you time to pray, and ye are begun to preach;&quot; he turned about upon
his knees, and said, &quot;Sir, you know neither the nature of preaching or
praying, that calls this preaching.&quot; Then continued without confusion.
When ended, Claverhouse said, &quot;Take goodnight of your wife and
children.&quot; His wife, standing by with her child in her arms that she had
brought forth to him, and another child of his first wife's, he came
to her, and said, &quot;Now, Marion, the day is come, that I told you would
come, when I spake first to you of marrying me.&quot; She said, &quot;Indeed,
John, I can willingly part with you.&quot;&mdash;&quot;Then,&quot; he said, &quot;this is all I
desire, I have no more to do but die.&quot; He kissed his wife and bairns,
and wished purchased and promised blessings to be multiplied upon them,
and his blessing. Clavers ordered six soldiers to shoot him; the most
part of the bullets came upon his head, which scattered his brains upon
the ground. Claverhouse said to his wife, &quot;What thinkest thou of thy
husband now, woman?&quot; She said, &quot;I thought ever much of him, and now as
much as ever.&quot; He said, &quot;It were justice to lay thee beside him.&quot; She
said, &quot;If ye were permitted, I doubt not but your cruelty would go that
length; but how will ye make answer for this morning's work?&quot; He said,
&quot;To man I can be answerable; and for God, I will take him in my own
hand.&quot; Claverhouse mounted his horse, and marched, and left her with the
corpse of her dead husband lying there; she set the bairn on the ground,
and gathered his brains, and tied up his head, and straighted his body,
and covered him in her plaid, and sat down, and wept over him. It being
a very desart place, where never victual grew, and far from neighbours,
it was some time before any friends came to her; the first that came was
a very fit hand, that old singular Christian woman, in the Cummerhead,
named Elizabeth Menzies, three miles distant, who had been tried with
the violent death of her husband at Pentland, afterwards of two worthy
sons, Thomas Weir, who was killed at Drumclog, and David Steel, who was
suddenly shot afterwards when taken. The said Marion Weir, sitting upon
her husband's grave, told me, that before that, she could see no blood
but she was in danger to faint; and yet she was helped to be a witness
to all this, without either fainting or confusion, except when the shots
were let off her eyes dazzled. His corpse were buried at the end of his
house, where he was slain, with this inscription on his grave-stone:&mdash;</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In earth's cold bed, the dusty part here lies,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of one who did the earth as dust despise!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Here, in this place, from earth he took departure;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now, he has got the garland of the martyrs.</span><br>

<a name="Footnote_A_34"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_34">[A]</a><div class="note"><p> The enthusiasm of this personage, and of his followers,
invested him, as has been already noticed, with prophetic powers; but
hardly any of the stories told of him exceeds that sort of gloomy
conjecture of misfortune, which the precarious situation of his sect
so greatly fostered. The following passage relates to the battle
of Bothwell-bridge:&mdash;&quot;That dismal day, 22d of June, 1679, at
Bothwell-bridge, when the Lord's people fell and fled before the enemy,
he was forty miles distant, near the border, and kept himself retired
until the middle of the day, when some friends said to him, 'Sir, the
people are waiting for sermon,' He answered, 'Let them go to their
prayers; for me, I neither can nor will preach any this day, for our
friends are fallen and fled before the enemy, at Hamilton, and they are
hacking and hewing them down, and their blood is running like water.&quot;
The feats of Peden are thus commemorated by Fountainhall, 27th of March,
1650: &quot;News came to the privy council, that about one hundred men, well
armed and appointed, had left Ireland, because of a search there for
such malcontents, and landed in the west of Scotland, and joined with
the wild fanatics. The council, finding that they disappointed the
forces, by skulking from hole to hole, were of opinion, it were better
to let them gather into a body, and draw to a head, and so they would
get them altogether in a snare. They had one Mr Peden, a minister, with
them, and one Isaac, who commanded them. They had frighted most part
of all the country ministers, so that they durst not stay at their
churches, but retired to Edinburgh, or to garrison towns; and it was sad
to see whole shires destitute of preaching, except in burghs. Wherever
they came they plundered arms, and particularly at my Lord Dumfries's
house.&quot;&mdash;FOUNTAINHALL, Vol. I. p. 359.</p></div>

<p>&quot;This murder was committed betwixt six and seven in the morning: Mr
Peden was about ten or eleven miles distant, having been in the fields
all night: he came to the house betwixt seven and eight, and desired to
call in the family, that he might pray amongst them; when praying, he
said, &quot;Lord, when wilt thou avenge Brown's blood? Oh, let Brown's blood
be precious in thy sight! and hasten the day when thou wilt avenge it,
with Cameron's, Cargil's, and many others of our martyrs' names; and oh!
for that day, when the Lord would avenge all their bloods!&quot; When ended,
John Muirhead enquired what he meant by Brown's blood? He said twice
over, &quot;What do I mean? Claverhouse has been at the Preshil this morning,
and has cruelly murdered John Brown; his corpse are lying at the end of
his house, and his poor wife sitting weeping by his corpse, and not a
soul to speak a word comfortably to her.&quot;</p>

<p>While we read this dismal story, we must remember Brown's situation
was that of an avowed and determined rebel, liable as such to military
execution; so that the atrocity was more that of the times than of
Claverhouse. That general's gallant adherence to his master, the
misguided James VII., and his glorious death on the field of victory, at
Killicrankie, have tended to preserve and gild his memory. He is still
remembered in the Highlands as the most successful leader of their
clans. An ancient gentleman, who had borne arms for the cause of Stuart,
in 1715, told the editor, that, when the armies met on the field of
battle, at Sheriff-muir, a veteran chief (I think he named Gordon
of Glenbucket), covered with scars, came up to the earl of Mar, and
earnestly pressed him to order the Highlanders to charge, before the
regular army of Argyle had completely formed their line, and at a moment
when the rapid and furious onset of the clans might have thrown them
into total disorder. Mar repeatedly answered, it was not yet time; till
the chieftain turned from him in disdain and despair, and, stamping with
rage, exclaimed aloud, &quot;O for one hour of Dundee!&quot;</p>

<p>Claverhouse's sword (a strait cut-and-thrust blade) is in the possession
of Lord Woodhouselee. In Pennycuik-house is preserved the buff-coat,
which he wore at the battle of Killicrankie. The fatal shot-hole is
under the arm-pit, so that the ball must have been received while his
arm was raised to direct the pursuit However he came by his charm of
<i>proof</i>, he certainly had not worn the garment usually supposed to
confer that privelage, and which is called <i>the waistcoat of proof, or
of necessity</i>. It was thus made: &quot;On Christmas daie, at night, a thread
must be sponne of flax, by a little virgine girle, in the name of the
divell: and it must be by her woven, and also wrought with the needle.
In the breast, or forepart thereof, must be made with needle work, two
heads; on the head, at the right side, must be a hat and a long beard;
the left head must have on a crown, and it must be so horrible that it
maie resemble Belzebub; and on each side of the wastcote must be made a
crosse.&quot;&mdash;SCOTT'S <i>Discoverie of Witchcraft,</i> p. 231.</p>

<p>It would be now no difficult matter to bring down our popular poetry,
connected with history, to the year 1745. But almost all the party
ballads of that period have been already printed, and ably illustrated
by Mr Ritson.</p>

<p>&quot;So fell it out of late years, that an English gentleman, travelling in
Palestine, not far from Jerusalem, as he passed through a country town,
he heard, by chance, a woman sitting at her door, dandling her child, to
sing, <i>Bothwel bank thou blumest fair</i>. The gentleman hereat wondered,
and forthwith, in English, saluted the woman, who joyfully answered him;
and said, she was right glad there to see a gentleman of our isle: and
told him, that she was a Scottish woman, and came first from Scotland to
Venice, and from Venice thither, where her fortune was to be the wife of
an officer under the Turk; who being at that instant absent, and very
soon to return, she entreated the gentleman to stay there until his
return. The which he did; and she, for country sake, to shew herself the
more kind and bountiful unto him, told her husband, at his home-coming,
that the gentleman was her kinsman; whereupon her husband entertained
him very kindly; and, at his departure gave him divers things of good
value.&quot;&mdash;<i>Verstigan's Restitution of Decayed Intelligence.</i> Chap. <i>Of

<br>

<p>INTRODUCTION TO THE TALE OF TAMLANE.</p>
<br>

<p>ON THE FAIRIES OF POPULAR SUPERSTITION.</p>


<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>&quot;Of airy elves, by moon-light shadows seen,</i></span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>The silver token, and the circled green.</i>&mdash;POPE.</span><br>

<p>In a work, avowedly dedicated to the preservation of the poetry and
tradition of the &quot;olden time,&quot; it would be unpardonable to omit this
opportunity of making some observations upon so interesting an article
of the popular creed, as that concerning the Elves, or Fairies. The
general idea of spirits, of a limited power, and subordinate nature,
dwelling among the woods and mountains, is, perhaps common to all
nations. But the intermixture of tribes, of languages, and religion,
which has occurred in Europe, renders it difficult to trace the origin
of the names which have been bestowed upon such spirits, and the primary
ideas which were entertained concerning their manners and habits.</p>

<p>The word <i>elf</i>, which seems to have been the original name of the
beings, afterwards denominated fairies, is of Gothic origin, and
probably signified, simply, a spirit of a lower order. Thus, the Saxons
had not only <i>dun-elfen, berg-elfen</i>,and <i>munt-elfen</i>, spirits of
the downs, hills, and mountains; but also <i>feld-elfen, wudu-elfen,
sae-elfen</i>, and <i>water-elfen</i>; spirits of the fields, of the woods,
of the sea, and of the waters. In low German, the same latitude of
expression occurs; for night hags are termed <i>aluinnen</i>, and <i>aluen</i>,
which is sometimes Latinized <i>eluoe</i>. But the prototype of the English
elf, is to be sought chiefly in the <i>berg-elfen</i>, or <i>duergar</i>, of the
Scandinavians. From the most early of the Icelandic Sagas, as well as
from the Edda itself, we learn the belief of the northern nations in
a race of dwarfish spirits, inhabiting the rocky mountains, and
approaching, in some respects, to the human nature. Their attributes,
amongst which we recognize the features of the modern Fairy, were,
supernatural wisdom and prescience, and skill in the mechanical arts,
especially in the fabrication of arms. They are farther described, as
capricious, vindictive, and easily irritated. The story of the elfin
sword, <i>Tyrfing</i>, may be the most pleasing illustration of this
position. Suafurlami, a Scandinavian monarch, returning from hunting,
bewildered himself among the mountains. About sun-set, he beheld a large
rock, and two dwarfs, sitting before the mouth of a cavern. The king
drew his sword, and intercepted their retreat, by springing betwixt
them and their recess, and imposed upon them the following condition of
safety:&mdash;that they should make for him a faulchion, with a baldric and
scabbard of pure gold, and a blade, which should divide stones and iron
as a garment, and which should render the wielder ever victorious in
battle. The elves complied with the requisition, and Suafurlami pursued
his way home. Returning at the time appointed, the dwarfs delivered to
him the famous sword <i>Tyrfing</i>; then, standing in the entrance of their
cavern, spoke thus: &quot;This sword, O king, shall &quot;destroy a man every time
it is brandished; but it shall &quot;perform three atrocious deeds, and it
shall be thy bane.&quot; The king rushed forward with the charmed sword, and
buried both its edges in the rock; but the dwarfs escaped into their
recesses.<a name="FNanchor_A_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_38"><sup>[A]</sup></a> This enchanted sword emitted rays like the sun, dazzling
all against whom it was brandished; it divided steel like water, and was
never unsheathed without slaying a man&mdash;<i>Hervarar Saga,</i> p. 9. Similar
to this was the enchanted sword, <i>Skoffhung</i>, which was taken by a
pirate out of the tomb of a Norwegian monarch. Many such tales are
narrated in the Sagas; but the most distinct account of the <i>-duergar</i>,
or elves, and their attributes, is to be found in a preface of Torfaeus
to the history of Hrolf Kraka, who cites a dissertation by Einar
Gudmund, a learned native of Iceland. &quot;I am firmly of opinion,&quot; says the
Icelander, &quot;that these beings are creatures of God, consisting, like
human beings, of a body and rational soul; that they are of different
sexes, and capable of producing children, and subject to all human
affections, as sleeping and waking, laughing and crying, poverty and
wealth; and that they possess cattle, and other effects, and are
obnoxious to death, like other mortals.&quot; He proceeds to state, that the
females of this race are capable of procreating with mankind; and gives
an account of one who bore a child to an inhabitant of Iceland, for whom
she claimed the privilege of baptism; depositing the infant, for that
purpose, at the gate of the church-yard, together with a goblet of gold,
as an offering.&mdash;<i>Historia Hrolfi Krakae, a</i> TORFAEO.</p>

<a name="Footnote_A_38"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_38">[A]</a><div class="note"><p> Perhaps in this, and similar tales, we may recognize
something of real history. That the Fins, or ancient natives of
Scandinavia, were driven into the mountains, by the invasion of Odin and
his Asiatics, is sufficiently probable; and there is reason to believe,
that the aboriginal inhabitants understood, better than the intruders,
how to manufacture the produce of their own mines. It is therefore
possible, that, in process of time, the oppressed Fins may have been
transformed into the supernatural <i>duergar</i>. A similar transformation
has taken place among the vulgar in Scotland, regarding the Picts, or
Pechs, to whom they ascribe various supernatural attributes.</p></div>

<p>Similar to the traditions of the Icelanders, are those current among the
Laplanders of Finland, concerning a subterranean people, gifted with'
supernatural qualities, and inhabiting the recesses of the earth.
Resembling men in their general appearance, the manner of their
existence, and their habits of life, they far excel the miserable
Laplanders in perfection of nature, felicity of situation, and skill in
mechanical arts. From all these advantages, however, after the partial
conversion of the Laplanders, the subterranean people have derived no
farther credit, than to be confounded with the devils and magicians of
the dark ages of Christianity; a degradation which, as will shortly be
demonstrated, has been also suffered by the harmless Fairies of Albion,
and indeed by the whole host of deities of learned Greece and mighty
Rome. The ancient opinions are yet so firmly rooted, that the Laps of
Finland, at this day, boast of an intercourse with these beings, in
banquets, dances, and magical ceremonies, and even in the more intimate
commerce of gallantry. They talk, with triumph, of the feasts which
they have shared in the elfin caverns, where wine and tobacco, the
productions of the Fairy region, went round in abundance, and whence
the mortal guest, after receiving the kindest treatment and the most
salutary counsel, has been conducted to his tent by an escort of his
supernatural entertainers.&mdash;<i>Jessens, de Lapponibus.</i></p>

<p>The superstitions of the islands of Feroe, concerning their
<i>Froddenskemen</i>, or under-ground people, are derived from the <i>duergar</i>
of Scandinavia. These beings are supposed to inhabit the interior
recesses of mountains, which they enter by invisible passages. Like the
Fairies, they are supposed to steal human beings. &quot;It happened,&quot; says
Debes, p. 354, &quot;a good while since, when the burghers of Bergen had
the commerce of Feroe, that there was a man in Servaade, called Jonas
Soideman, who was kept by spirits in a mountain, during the space of
seven years, and at length came out; but lived afterwards in great
distress and fear, lest they should again take him away; wherefore
people were obliged to watch him in the night.&quot; The same author mentions
another young man, who had been carried away, and, after his return, was
removed a second time upon the eve of his marriage. He returned in a
short time, and narrated, that the spirit that had carried him away, was
in the shape of a most beautiful woman, who pressed him to forsake his
bride, and remain with her; urging her own superior beauty, and splendid
appearance. He added, that he saw the men who were employed to search
for him, and heard them call; but that they could not see him, nor could
he answer them, till, upon his determined refusal to listen to the
spirit's persuasions, the spell ceased to operate. The kidney-shaped
West Indian bean, which is sometimes driven upon the shore of the
Feroes, is termed, by the natives &quot;the <i>Fairie's kidney</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>In these traditions of the Gothic and Finnish tribes, we may recognize,
with certainty, the rudiments of elfin superstition; but we must look to
various other causes for the modifications which it has undergone. These
are to be sought, 1st, in the traditions of the east; 2d, in the wreck
and confusion of the Gothic mythology; 3d, in the tales of chivalry;
4th, in the fables of classical antiquity; 5th, in the influence of the
Christian religion; 6th, and finally, in the creative imagination of
the sixteenth century. It may be proper to notice the effect of these
various causes, before stating the popular belief of our own time,
regarding the Fairies.</p>

<p>I. To the traditions of the east, the Fairies of Britain owe, I think,
little more than the appellation, by which they have been distinguished
since the days of the crusade. The term &quot;Fairy,&quot; occurs not only
in Chaucer, and in yet older English authors, but also, and more
frequently, in the romance language; from which they seem to have
adopted it. Ducange cites the following passage from Gul. Guiart, in
<i>Historia Francica</i>, MS.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Plusiers parlent de Guenart,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Du Lou, de L'Asne, de Renart,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">De <i>Fa&euml;ries</i> et de Songes,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">De phantosmes et de mensonges.</span><br>

<p>The <i>Lay le Frain</i>,enumerating the subjects of the Breton Lays, informs
us expressly,</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Many ther beth <i>fa&euml;ry</i>.</span><br>

<p>By some etymologists of that learned class, who not only know whence
words come, but also whither they are going, the term <i>Fairy</i>, or
<i>Fa&euml;rie</i>, is derived from <i>Fa&euml;</i>, which is again derived from <i>Nympha</i>.
It is more probable the term is of oriental origin, and is derived from
the Persic, through the medium of the Arabic. In Persic, the term <i>Peri</i>
expresses a species of imaginary being, which resembles the Fairy in
some of its qualities, and is one of the fairest creatures of romantic
fancy. This superstition must have been known to the Arabs, among whom
the Persian tales, or romances, even as early as the time of Mahomet,
were so popular, that it required the most terrible denunciations of
that legislator to proscribe them. Now, in the enunciation of the Arabs,
the term <i>Peri</i> would sound <i>Fairy</i>, the letter <i>p</i> not occurring in
the alphabet of that nation; and, as the chief intercourse of the early
crusaders was with the Arabs, or Saracens, it is probable they would
adopt the term according to their pronounciation. Neither will it be
considered as an objection to this opinion, that in Hesychius, the
Ionian term <i>Phereas</i>, or <i>Pheres</i>, denotes the satyrs of classical
antiquity, if the number of words of oriental origin in that
lexicographer be recollected. Of the Persian Peris, Ouseley, in his
<i>Persian Miscellanies</i>, has described some characteristic traits, with
all the luxuriance of a fancy, impregnated with the oriental association
of ideas. However vaguely their nature and appearance is described, they
are uniformly represented as gentle, amiable females, to whose character
beneficence and beauty are essential. None of them are mischievous or
malignant; none of them are deformed or diminutive, like the Gothic
fairy. Though they correspond in beauty with our ideas of angels, their
employments are dissimilar; and, as they have no place in heaven, their
abode is different. Neither do they resemble those intelligences, whom,
on account of their wisdom, the Platonists denominated Daemons; nor
do they correspond either to the guardian Genii of the Romans, or the
celestial virgins of paradise, whom the Arabs denominate Houri. But the
Peris hover in the balmy clouds, live in the colours of the rainbow,
and, as the exquisite purity of their nature rejects all nourishment
grosser than the odours of flowers, they subsist by inhaling the
fragrance of the jessamine and rose. Though their existence is not
commensurate with the bounds of human life, they are not exempted from
the common fate of mortals.&mdash;With the Peris, in Persian mythology, are
contrasted the Dives, a race of beings, who differ from them in sex,
appearance, and disposition. These are represented as of the male sex,
cruel, wicked, and of the most hideous aspect; or, as they are described
by Mr Finch, &quot;with ugly shapes, long horns, staring eyes, shaggy hair,
great fangs, ugly paws, long tails, with such horrible difformity and
deformity, that I wonder the poor women are not frightened therewith.&quot;
Though they live very long, their lives are limited, and they are
obnoxious to the blows of a human foe. From the malignancy of their
nature, they not only wage war with mankind, but persecute the Peris
with unremitting ferocity. Such are the brilliant and fanciful colours
in which the imaginations of the Persian poets have depicted the
charming race of the Peris; and, if we consider the romantic gallantry
of the knights of chivalry, and of the crusaders, it will not appear
improbable, that their charms might occasionally fascinate the fervid
imagination of an amorous troubadour. But, further; the intercourse of
France and Italy with the Moors of Spain, and the prevalence of the
Arabic, as the language of science in the dark ages, facilitated the
introduction of their mythology amongst the nations of the west. Hence,
the romances of France, of Spain, and of Italy, unite in describing the
Fairy as an inferior spirit, in a beautiful female form, possessing many
of the amiable qualities of the eastern Peri. Nay, it seems sufficiently
clear, that the romancers borrowed from the Arabs, not merely the
general idea concerning those spirits, but even the names of individuals
amongst them. The Peri, <i>Mergian Banou</i> (see <i>Herbelot, ap. Peri</i>),
celebrated in the ancient Persian poetry, figures in the European
romances, under the various names of <i>Mourgue La Faye</i>, sister to <i>King
Arthur; Urgande La Deconnue</i>, protectress of <i>Amadis de Gaul</i>; and the
<i>Fata Morgana</i> of Boiardo and Ariosto. The description of these nymphs,
by the troubadours and minstrels, is in no respect inferior to those of
the Peris. In the tale of <i>Sir Launfal</i>, in Way's <i>Fabliaux</i>, as well as
in that of <i>Sir Gruelan</i>, in the same interesting collection, the reader
will find the fairy of Normandy, or Bretagne, adorned with all the
splendour of eastern description. The fairy <i>Melusina</i>, also, who
married Guy de Lusignan, count of Poictou, under condition that he
should never attempt to intrude upon her privacy, was of this latter
class. She bore the count many children, and erected for him a
magnificent castle by her magical art. Their harmony was uninterrupted,
until the prying husband broke the conditions of their union, by
concealing himself, to behold his wife make use of her enchanted
bath. Hardly had <i>Melusina</i> discovered the indiscreet intruder, than,
transforming herself into a dragon, she departed with a loud yell of
lamentation, and was never again visible to mortal eyes; although, even
in the days of Brantome, she was supposed to be the protectress of her
descendants, and was heard wailing, as she sailed upon the blast
round the turrets of the castle of Lusiguan, the night before it was
demolished. For the full story, the reader may consult the <i>Bibliotheque
des Romans</i>.<a name="FNanchor_A_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_39"><sup>[A]</sup></a>&mdash;Gervase of Tilbury (pp. 895, and 989), assures us,
that, in his days, the lovers of the Fadae, or Fairies, were numerous;
and describes the rules of their intercourse with as much accuracy, as
if he had himself been engaged in such an affair. Sir David Lindsay also
informs us, that a leopard is the proper armorial bearing of those
who spring from such intercourse, because that beast is generated by
adultery of the pard and lioness. He adds, that Merlin, the prophet, was
the first who adopted this cognizance, because he was &quot;borne of faarie
in adultre, and right sua the first duk of Guyenne, was borne of a
<i>fee</i>; and, therefoir, the armes of Guyenne are a leopard.&quot;&mdash;<i>MS. on
Heraldry, Advocates' Library,</i> w. 4. 13. While, however, the Fairy of
warmer climes was thus held up as an object of desire and of affection,
those of Britain, and more especially those of Scotland, were far
from being so fortunate; but, retaining the unamiable qualities, and
diminutive size of the Gothic elves, they only exchanged that term for
the more popular appellation of Fairies.</p>

<a name="Footnote_A_39"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_39">[A]</a><div class="note"><p> Upon this, or some similar tradition, was founded the
notion, which the inveteracy of national prejudice, so easily diffused
in Scotland, that the ancestor of the English monarchs, Geoffrey
Plantagenet, had actually married a daemon. Bowmaker, in order to
explain the cruelty and ambition of Edward I., dedicates a chapter to
shew &quot;how the kings of England are descended from the devil, by the
mother's side.&quot;&mdash;<i>Fordun, Chron.</i> lib. 9, cap. 6. The lord of a certain
castle, called Espervel, was unfortunate enough to have a wife of the
same class. Having observed, for several years, that she always left the
chapel before the mass was concluded, the baron, in a fit of obstinacy
or curiosity, ordered his guard to detain her by force; of which the
consequence was, that, unable to support the elevation of the host, she
retreated through the air, carrying with her one side of the chapel, and
several of the congregation.</p></div>

<p>II. Indeed, so singularly unlucky were the British Fairies that, as has
already been hinted, amid the wreck of the Gothic mythology, consequent
upon the introduction of Christianity, they seem to have preserved, with
difficulty, their own distinct characteristics, while, at the same time,
they engrossed the mischievous attributes of several other classes of
subordinate spirits, acknowledged by the nations of the north. The
abstraction of children, for example, the well known practice of the
modern Fairy, seems, by the ancient Gothic nations, to have rather been
ascribed to a species of night-mare, or hag, than to the <i>berg-elfen</i>,
or <i>duergar</i>. In the ancient legend of <i>St Margaret</i>, of which there is
a Saxo-Norman copy, in <i>Hickes' Thesaurus Linguar. Septen.</i> and one,
more modern, in the Auchinleck MSS., that lady encounters a fiend, whose
profession it was, among other malicious tricks, to injure new-born
children and their mothers; a practice afterwards imputed to the
Fairies. Gervase of Tilbury, in the <i>Otia Imperialia</i>, mentions certain
hags, or <i>Lamiae</i>, who entered into houses in the night-time, to oppress
the inhabitants, while asleep, injure their persons and property, and
carry off their children. He likewise mentions the <i>Dracae</i>, a sort of
water spirits, who inveigle women and children into the recesses which
they inhabit, beneath lakes and rivers, by floating past them, on the
surface of the water, in the shape of gold rings, or cups. The women,
thus seized, are employed as nurses, and, after seven years, are
permitted to revisit earth. Gervase mentions one woman, in particular,
who had been allured by observing a wooden dish, or cup, float by her,
while washing clothes in a river. Being seized as soon as she reached
the depths, she was conducted into one of these subterranean recesses,
which she described as very magnificent, and employed as nurse to one of
the brood of the hag who had allured her. During her residence in this
capacity, having accidentally touched one of her eyes with an ointment
of serpent's grease, she perceived, at her return to the world, that she
had acquired the faculty of seeing the <i>dracae</i>, when they intermingle
themselves with men. Of this power she was, however, deprived by the
touch of her ghostly mistress, whom she had one day incautiously
addressed. It is a curious fact, that this story, in almost all its
parts, is current in both the Highlands and Lowlands of Scotland, with
no other variation than the substitution of Fairies for <i>dracae</i>, and
the cavern of a hill for that of a river.<a name="FNanchor_A_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_40"><sup>[A]</sup></a> These water fiends are thus

<a name="Footnote_A_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_40">[A]</a><div class="note"><p> Indeed, many of the vulgar account it extremely dangerous
to touch any thing, which they may happen to find, without <i>saining</i>
(blessing) it, the snares of the enemy being notorious and well
attested. A poor woman of Tiviotdale, having been fortunate enough, as
she thought herself, to find a wooden beetle, at the very time when
she needed such an implement, seized it without pronouncing the proper
blessing, and, carrying it home, laid it above her bed, to be ready
for employment in the morning. At midnight, the window of her cottage
opened, and a loud voice was heard, calling upon some one within, by a
strange and uncouth name, which I have forgotten. The terrified cottager
ejaculated a prayer, which, we may suppose, insured her personal
safety; while the enchanted implement of housewifery, tumbling from the
bed-stead, departed by the window with no small noise and precipitation.
In a humorous fugitive tract, the late Dr Johnson is introduced as
disputing the authenticity of an apparition, merely because the spirit
assumed the shape of a tea-pot, and of a shoulder of mutton. No doubt,
a case so much in point, as that we have now quoted, would have removed
his incredulity.</p></div>

<p>The following Frisian superstition, related by Schott, in his <i>Physica
Curiosa</i>, p. 362, on the authority of Cornelius a Kempen, coincides more
accurately with the popular opinions concerning the Fairies, than even
the <i>dracae</i> of Gervase, or the water-spirits of Thomas Heywood.&mdash;&quot;In
the time of the emperor Lotharius, in 830,&quot; says he, &quot;many spectres
infested Frieseland, particularly the white nymphs of the ancients,
which the moderns denominate <i>witte wiven</i>, who inhabited a
subterraneous cavern, formed in a wonderful manner, without human art,
on the top of a lofty mountain. These were accustomed to surprise
benighted travellers, shepherds watching their herds and flocks, and
women newly delivered, with their children; and convey them into their
caverns, from which subterranean murmurs, the cries of children, the
groans and lamentations of men, and sometimes imperfect words, and all
kinds of musical sounds, were heard to proceed.&quot; The same superstition
is detailed by Bekker, in his <i>World Bewitch'd</i>, p. 196, of the English
translation. As the different classes of spirits were gradually
confounded, the abstraction of children seems to have been chiefly
ascribed to the elves, or Fairies; yet not so entirely, as to exclude
hags and witches from the occasional exertion of their ancient
privilege.&mdash;In Germany, the same confusion of classes has not taken
place. In the beautiful ballads of the <i>Erl King</i>, the <i>Water King</i>, and
the <i>Mer-Maid</i>, we still recognize the ancient traditions of the Goths,
concerning the <i>wald-elven</i>, and the <i>dracae</i>.</p>

<p>A similar superstition, concerning abstraction by daemons, seems, in
the time of Gervase of Tilbury, to have pervaded the greatest part of
Europe. &quot;In Catalonia,&quot; says that author, &quot;there is a lofty mountain,
named Cavagum, at the foot of which runs a river with golden sands, in
the vicinity of which there are likewise mines of silver. This mountain
is steep, and almost inaccessible. On its top, which is always covered
with ice and snow, is a black and bottomless lake, into which if a
stone be thrown, a tempest suddenly rises; and near this lake, though
invisible to men, is the porch of the palace of daemons. In a town
adjacent to this mountain, named Junchera, lived one Peter de Cabinam.
Being one day teazed with the fretfulness of his young daughter, he, in
his impatience, suddenly wished that the devil might take her; when she
was immediately borne away by the spirits. About seven years afterwards,
an inhabitant of the same city, passing by the mountain, met a man, who
complained bitterly of the burthen he was constantly forced to bear.
Upon enquiring the cause of his complaining, as he did not seem to carry
any load, the man related, that he had been unwarily devoted to the
spirits by an execration, and that they now employed him constantly as
a vehicle of burthen. As a proof of his assertion, he added, that the
daughter of his fellow-citizen was detained by the spirits, but that
they were willing to restore her, if her father would come and demand
her on the mountain. Peter de Cabinam, on being informed of this,
ascended the mountain to the lake, and, in the name of God, demanded his
daughter; when, a tall, thin, withered figure, with wandering eyes, and
almost bereft of understanding, was wafted to him in a blast of wind.
After some time, the person, who had been employed as the vehicle of the
spirits, also returned, when he related where the palace of the spirits
was situated; but added, that none were permitted to enter but those who
devoted themselves entirely to the spirits; those, who had been rashly
committed to the devil by others, being only permitted, during their
probation, to enter the porch.&quot; It may be proper to observe, that the
superstitious idea, concerning the lake on the top of the mountain, is
common to almost every high hill in Scotland. Wells, or pits, on the
top of high hills, were likewise supposed to lead to the subterranean
habitations of the Fairies. Thus, Gervase relates, (p. 975), &quot;that he
was informed the swine-herd of William Peverell, an English baron,
having lost a brood-sow, descended through a deep abyss, in the middle
of an ancient ruinous castle, situated on the top of a hill, called
Bech, in search of it. Though a violent wind commonly issued from
this pit, he found it calm; and pursued his way, till he arrived at a
subterraneous region, pleasant and cultivated, with reapers cutting down
corn, though the snow remained on the surface of the ground above. Among
the ears of corn he discovered his sow, and was permitted to ascend with
her, and the pigs which she had farrowed.&quot; Though the author seems to
think that the inhabitants of this cave might be Antipodes, yet, as
many such stories are related of the Fairies, it is probable that this
narration is of the same kind. Of a similar nature seems to be another
superstition, mentioned by the same author, concerning the ringing of
invisible bells, at the hour of one, in a field in the vicinity of
Carleol, which, as he relates, was denominated <i>Laikibraine</i>, or <i>Lai ki
brait</i>. From all these tales, we may perhaps be justified in supposing,
that the faculties and habits ascribed to the Fairies, by the
superstition of latter days, comprehended several, originally attributed
to other classes of inferior spirits.</p>

<p>III. The notions, arising from the spirit of chivalry, combined to add
to the Fairies certain qualities, less atrocious, indeed, but equally
formidable, with those which they derived from the last mentioned
source, and alike inconsistent with the powers of the <i>duergar</i>, whom
we may term their primitive prototype. From an early period, the daring
temper of the northern tribes urged them to defy even the supernatural
powers. In the days of Caesar, the Suevi were described, by their
countrymen, as a people, with whom the immortal gods dared not venture
to contend. At a later period, the historians of Scandinavia paint their
heroes and champions, not as bending at the altar of their deities, but
wandering into remote forests and caverns, descending into the recesses
of the tomb, and extorting boons, alike from gods and daemons, by dint
of the sword, and battle-axe. I will not detain the reader by quoting
instances, in which heaven is thus described as having been literally
attempted by storm. He may consult Saxo, Olaus Wormius, Olaus Magnus,
Torfaeus, Bartholin, and other northern antiquaries. With such ideas of
superior beings, the Normans, Saxons, and other Gothic tribes, brought
their ardent courage to ferment yet more highly in the genial climes of
the south, and under the blaze of romantic chivalry. Hence, during the
dark ages, the invisible world was modelled after the material; and the
saints, to the protection of whom the knights-errant were accustomed to
recommend themselves, were accoutered like <i>preux chevaliers</i>, by the
ardent imaginations of their votaries. With such ideas concerning the
inhabitants of the celestial regions, we ought not to be surprised to
find the inferior spirits, of a more dubious nature and origin, equipped
in the same disguise. Gervase of Tilbury (<i>Otia Imperial, ap. Script,
rer. Brunsvic,</i> Vol. I. p. 797.) relates the following popular story
concerning a Fairy Knight. &quot;Osbert, a bold and powerful baron, visited
a noble family in the vicinity of Wandlebury, in the bishopric of Ely.
Among other stories related in the social circle of his friends, who,
according to custom, amused each other by repeating ancient tales and
traditions, he was informed, that if any knight, unattended, entered an
adjacent plain by moon-light, and challenged an adversary to appear, he
would be immediately encountered by a spirit in the form of a knight.
Osbert resolved to make the experiment, and set out, attended by a
single squire, whom he ordered to remain without the limits of the
plain, which was surrounded by an ancient entrenchment. On repeating the
challenge, he was instantly assailed by an adversary, whom he quickly
unhorsed, and seized the reins of his steed. During this operation, his
ghostly opponent sprung up, and, darting his spear, like a javelin, at
Osbert, wounded him in the thigh. Osbert returned in triumph with the
horse, which he committed to the care of his servants. The horse was of
a sable colour, as well as his whole accoutrements, and apparently of
great beauty and vigour. He remained with his keeper till cock-crowing,
when, with eyes flashing fire, he reared, spurned the ground, and
vanished. On disarming himself, Osbert perceived that he was wounded,
and that one of his steel boots was full of blood. Gervase adds,
that, as long as he lived, the scar of his wound opened afresh on the
anniversary of the eve on which he encountered the spirit.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_A_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_41"><sup>[A]</sup></a> Less
fortunate was the gallant Bohemian knight, who, travelling by night,
with a single companion, came in sight of a fairy host, arrayed under
displayed banners. Despising the remonstrances of his friend, the knight
pricked forward to break a lance with a champion who advanced from
the ranks, apparently in defiance. His companion beheld the Bohemian
over-thrown horse and man, by his a&euml;rial adversary; and, returning to
the spot next morning, he found the mangled, corpse of the knight and
steed.&mdash;<i>Hierarchie of Blessed Angels,</i> p. 554.</p>

<a name="Footnote_A_41"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_41">[A]</a><div class="note"><p> The unfortunate Chatterton was not, probably, acquainted
with Gervase of Tilbury; yet he seems to allude, in the <i>Battle of
Hastings</i>, to some modification of Sir Osbert's adventure:
</p><p><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So who they be that ouphant fairies strike,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their souls shall wander to King Offa's dike.</span><br>
</p><p>
The entrenchment, which served as lists for the combatants, is said by
Gervase to have been the work of the pagan invaders of Britain. In the
metrical romance of <i>Arthour and Merlin</i>, we have also an account of
Wandlesbury being occupied by the Sarasins, i.e. the Saxons; for all
pagans were Saracens with the romancers. I presume the place to have
been Wodnesbury, in Wiltshire, situated on the remarkable mound,
called Wansdike, which is obviously a Saxon work.&mdash;GOUGH'S <i>Cambden's
Britannia,</i> pp. 87&mdash;95.</p></div>

<p>To the same current of warlike ideas, we may safely attribute the
long train of military processions which the Fairies are supposed
occasionally to exhibit. The elves, indeed, seem in this point to be
identified with the a&euml;rial host, termed, during the middle ages, the
<i>Milites Herlikini</i>, or <i>Herleurini</i>, celebrated by Pet. Blesensis,
and termed, in the life of St Thomas of Canterbury, the <i>Familia
Helliquinii</i>. The chief of this band was originally a gallant knight and
warrior; but, having spent his whole possessions in the service of the
emperor, and being rewarded with scorn, and abandoned to subordinate
oppression, he became desperate, and, with his sons and followers,
formed a band of robbers. After committing many ravages, and defeating
all the forces sent against him, Hellequin, with his whole troop, fell
in a bloody engagement with the Imperial host. His former good life was
supposed to save him from utter reprobation; but he and his followers
were condemned, after death, to a state of wandering, which should
endure till the last day. Retaining their military habits, they were
usually seen in the act of justing together, or in similar warlike
employments. See the ancient French romance of <i>Richard sans Peur</i>.
Similar to this was the <i>Nacht Lager</i>, or midnight camp, which seemed
nightly to beleaguer the walls of Prague,</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;With ghastly faces thronged, and fiery arms,&quot;</span><br>

<p>but which disappeared upon recitation of the magical words, <i>Vezel&eacute;,
Vezel&eacute;, ho! ho! ho!</i>&mdash;For similar delusions, see DELRIUS, pp. 294, 295.</p>

<p>The martial spirit of our ancestors led them to defy these a&euml;rial
warriors; and it is still currently believed, that he, who has courage
to rush upon a fairy festival, and snatch from them their drinking cup,
or horn, shall find it prove to him a cornucopia of good fortune, if he
can bear it in safety across a running stream. Such a horn is said to
have been presented to Henry I. by a lord of Colchester.&mdash;GERVAS TILB.
p. 980. A goblet is still carefully preserved in Edenhall, Cumberland,
which is supposed to have been seized at a banquet of the elves, by one
of the ancient family of Musgrave; or, as others say, by one of their
domestics, in the manner above described. The Fairy train vanished,
crying aloud,</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If this glass do break or fall,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Farewell the luck of Edenhall!</span><br>

<p>The goblet took a name from the prophecy, under which it is mentioned,
in the burlesque ballad, commonly attributed to the duke of Wharton, but
in reality composed by Lloyd, one of his jovial companions. The duke,
after taking a draught, had nearly terminated the &quot;luck of Edenhall,&quot;
had not the butler caught the cup in a napkin, as it dropped from his
grace's hands. I understand it is not now subjected to such risques, but
the lees of wine are still apparent at the bottom.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">God prosper long, from being broke,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The luck of Edenhall.&mdash;<i>Parody on Chevy Chace.</i></span><br>

<p>Some faint traces yet remain, on the borders, of a conflict of a
mysterious and terrible nature, between mortals and the spirits of the
wilds. This superstition is incidentally alluded to by Jackson, at the
beginning of the 17th century. The fern seed, which is supposed to
become visible only on St John's Eve,<a name="FNanchor_A_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_42"><sup>[A]</sup></a> and at the very moment when
the Baptist was born, is held by the vulgar to be under the special
protection of the queen of Fa&euml;ry. But, as the seed was supposed to have
the quality of rendering the possessor invisible at pleasure,<a name="FNanchor_B_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_43"><sup>[B]</sup></a> and to
be also of sovereign use in charms and incantations, persons of courage,
addicted to these mysterious arts, were wont to watch in solitude, to
gather it at the moment when it should become visible. The particular
charms, by which they fenced themselves during this vigil, are now
unknown; but it was reckoned a feat of no small danger, as the person
undertaking it was exposed to the most dreadful assaults from spirits,
who dreaded the effect of this powerful herb in the hands of a cabalist.
Such were the shades, which the original superstition, concerning the.
Fairies, received from the chivalrous sentiments of the middle ages.</p>

The whole history of St John the Baptist was, by our ancestors,
accounted mysterious, and connected with their own superstitions.
The fairy queen was sometimes identified with Herodias.&mdash;DELRII
<i>Disquisitiones Magicae,</i> pp. 168. 807. It is amusing to observe with
what gravity the learned Jesuit contends, that it is heresy to believe
that this celebrated figurante (<i>saltatricula</i>) still leads choral
dances upon earth!</p></div>

<a name="Footnote_B_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_43">[B]</a><div class="note"><p> This is alluded to by Shakespeare, and other authors of his
time:
</p><p><br>

<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Henry IV. Part 1st, Act 2d, Sc. 3</i>.</span></p></div><br>

<p>IV. An absurd belief in the fables of classical antiquity lent an
additional feature to the character of the woodland spirits of whom we
treat. Greece and Rome had not only assigned tutelary deities to each
province and city, but had peopled, with peculiar spirits, the Seas, the
Rivers, the Woods, and the Mountains. The memory of the pagan creed was
not speedily eradicated, in the extensive provinces through which it was
once universally received; and, in many particulars, it continued long
to mingle with, and influence, the original superstitions of the Gothic
nations. Hence, we find the elves occasionally arrayed in the costume of
Greece and Rome, and the Fairy Queen and her attendants transformed into
Diana and her nymphs, and invested with their attributes and appropriate
insignia.&mdash;DELRIUS, pp. 168, 807. According to the same author, the
Fairy Queen was also called <i>Habundia</i>. Like Diana, who, in one
capacity, was denominated <i>Hecate</i>, the goddess of enchantment, the
Fairy Queen is identified in popular tradition, with the <i>Gyre-Carline,
Gay Carline</i>, or mother witch, of the Scottish peasantry. Of this
personage, as an individual, we have but few notices. She is sometimes
termed <i>Nicneven</i>,and is mentioned in the <i>Complaynt of Scotland</i>, by
Lindsay in his <i>Dreme</i>, p. 225, edit. 1590, and in his <i>Interludes</i>,
apud PINKERTON'S <i>Scottish Poems</i>, Vol. II. p. 18. But the traditionary
accounts regarding her are too obscure to admit of explanation. In the
burlesque fragment subjoined, which is copied from the Bannatyne MS. the
Gyre Carline is termed the <i>Queen of Jowis</i> (Jovis, or perhaps Jews),
and is, with great consistency, married to Mohammed.<a name="FNanchor_A_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_44"><sup>[A]</sup></a></p>

<p>But chiefly in Italy were traced many dim characters of ancient
mythology, in the creed of tradition. Thus, so lately as 1536, Vulcan,
with twenty of his Cyclops, is stated to have presented himself suddenly
to a Spanish merchant, travelling in the night, through the forests of
Sicily; an apparition, which was followed by a dreadful eruption of
Mount Aetna.&mdash;<i>Hierarchie of the Blessed Angels,</i> p. 504 Of this
singular mixture, the reader will find a curious specimen in the
following tale, wherein the Venus of antiquity assumes the manners of
one of the Fays, or Fatae, of romance. &quot;In the year 1058, a young man
of noble birth had been married at Rome, and, during the period of his
nuptial feast, having gone with his companions to play at ball, he put
his marriage ring on the finger of a broken statue of Venus in the area,
to remain, while he was engaged in the recreation. Desisting from the
exercise, he found the finger, on which he had put his ring, contracted
firmly against the palm, and attempted in vain either to break it, or to
disengage his ring. He concealed the circumstance from his companions,
and returned at night with a servant, when he found the finger extended,
and his ring gone. He dissembled the loss, and returned to his wife;
but, whenever he attempted to embrace her, he found himself prevented
by something dark and dense, which was tangible, though not visible,
interposing between them; and he heard a voice saying, 'Embrace me! for
I am Venus, whom this day you wedded, and I will not restore your ring.'
As this was constantly repeated, he consulted his relations, who had
recourse to Palumbus, a priest, skilled in necromancy. He directed the
young man to go, at a certain hour of night, to a spot among the ruins
of ancient Rome, where four roads met, and wait silently till he saw a
company pass by, and then, without uttering a word, to deliver a letter,
which he gave him, to a majestic being, who rode in a chariot, after the
rest of the company. The young man did as he was directed; and saw a
company of all ages, sexes, and ranks, on horse and on foot, some joyful
and others sad, pass along; among whom he distinguished a woman in a
meretricious dress, who, from the tenuity of her garments, seemed
almost naked. She rode on a mule; her long hair, which flowed over her
shoulders, was bound with a golden fillet; and in her hand was a golden
rod, with which she directed her mule. In the close of the procession,
a tall majestic figure appeared in a chariot, adorned with emeralds
and pearls, who fiercely asked the young man, 'What he did there?' He
presented the letter in silence, which the daemon dared not refuse.
As soon as he had read, lifting up his hands to heaven, he exclaimed,
'Almighty God! how long wilt thou endure the iniquities of the sorcerer
Palumbus!' and immediately dispatched some of his attendants, who, with
much difficulty, extorted the ring from Venus, and restored it to
its owner, whose infernal banns were thus dissolved.&quot;&mdash;FORDUNI

<p>But it is rather in the classical character of an infernal deity, that
the elfin queen may be considered, than as <i>Hecate</i>, the patroness of
magic; for not only in the romance writers, but even in Chaucer, are the
Fairies identified with the ancient inhabitants of the classical hell.
Thus Chaucer, in his <i>Marchand's Tale</i>, mentions</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pluto that is king of fayrie&mdash;and</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Proserpine and all her fayrie.</span><br>

<p>In the <i>Golden Terge</i> of Dunbar, the same phraseology is adopted: Thus,</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thair was Pluto that elricke incubus</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In cloke of grene, his court usit in sable.</span><br>

<p>Even so late as 1602, in Harsenet's <i>Declaration of Popish Imposture,</i>
p. 57, Mercury is called <i>Prince of the Fairies.</i></p>

<p>But Chaucer, and those poets who have adopted his phraseology, have only
followed the romance writers; for the same substitution occurs in the
romance of <i>Orfeo and Heurodis</i>, in which the story of Orpheus and
Eurydice is transformed into a beautiful romantic tale of fa&euml;ry, and
the Gothic mythology engrafted on the fables of Greece. <i>Heurodis</i> is
represented as wife of <i>Orfeo</i>, and queen of Winchester, the ancient
name of which city the romancer, with unparalleled ingenuity, discovers
to have been Traciens, or Thrace. The monarch, her husband, had a
singular genealogy:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His fader was comen of King Pluto,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And his moder of King Juno;</span><br>

<p>The King of Fairies, who had obtained power over the queen, perhaps from
her sleeping at noon in his domain, orders her, under the penalty of
being torn to pieces, to await him to-morrow under the ymp tree, and
accompany him to Fairy-Land. She relates her dream to her husband, who
resolves to accompany her, and attempt her rescue:</p>

<p>After this fatal catastrophe, <i>Orfeo</i>, distracted for the loss of
his queen, abandons his throne, and, with his harp, retires into a
wilderness, where he subjects himself to every kind of austerity, and
attracts the wild beasts by the pathetic melody of his harp. His state
of desolation is poetically described:</p>

<p>In consequence, therefore, of this discovery <i>Orfeo</i> pursues the hawking
damsels, among whom he has descried his lost queen. They enter a rock,
the king continues the pursuit, and arrives at Fairy-Land, of which the
following very poetical description is given:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In at roche the leuedis rideth,</span><br>

<p><i>Orfeo</i>, as a minstrel, so charms the Fairy King with the music of
his harp, that he promises to grant him whatever he should ask. He
immediately demands his lost <i>Heurodis</i>; and, returning safely with
her to Winchester, resumes his authority; a catastrophe, less pathetic
indeed, but more pleasing, than that of the classical story. The
circumstances, mentioned in this romantic legend, correspond very
exactly with popular tradition. Almost all the writers on daemonology
mention, as a received opinion that the power of the daemons is most
predominant at noon and midnight. The entrance to the Land of Fa&euml;ry is
placed in the wilderness; a circumstance, which coincides with a passage
in Lindsay's <i>Complaint of the Papingo:</i></p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bot sen my spreit mon from my bodye go,</span><br>

<p>V. Other two causes, deeply affecting the superstition of which we
treat, remain yet to be noticed. The first is derived from the Christian
religion, which admits only of two classes of spirits, exclusive of the
souls of men&mdash;Angels, namely, and Devils. This doctrine had a necessary
tendency to abolish the distinction among subordinate spirits, which had
been introduced by the superstitions of the Scandinavians. The existence
of the Fairies was readily admitted; but, as they had no pretensions to
the angelic character, they were deemed to be of infernal origin. The
union, also, which had been formed betwixt the elves and the Pagan
deities, was probably of disservice to the former; since every one
knows, that the whole synod of Olympus were accounted daemons.</p>

<p>The fulminations of the church were, therefore, early directed against
those, who consulted or consorted with the Fairies; and, according to
the inquisitorial logic, the innocuous choristers of Oberon and Titania
were, without remorse, confounded with the sable inhabitants of the
orthodox Gehennim; while the rings, which marked their revels, were
assimilated to the blasted sward on which the witches held their
infernal sabbath.&mdash;<i>Delrii Disq. Mag.</i> p. 179. This transformation early
took place; for, among the many crimes for which the famous Joan of Arc
was called upon to answer, it was not the least heinous, that she
had frequented the Tree and Fountain, near Dompr&eacute;, which formed the
rendezvous of the Fairies, and bore their name; that she had joined in
the festive dance with the elves, who haunted this charmed spot; had
accepted of their magical bouquets, and availed herself of their
talismans, for the delivery of her country.&mdash;<i>Vide Acta Judiciaria
contra Johannam D'Arceam, vulgo vocutam Johanne la Pucelle.</i></p>

<p>The Reformation swept away many of the corruptions of the church of
Rome; but the purifying torrent remained itself somewhat tinctured by
the superstitious impurities of the soil over which it had passed. The
trials of sorcerers and witches, which disgrace our criminal records,
become even more frequent after the Reformation of the church; as if
human credulity, no longer amused by the miracles of Rome, had sought
for food in the traditionary records of popular superstition. A Judaical
observation of the precepts of the Old Testament also characterized the
Presbyterian reformers. <i>&quot;Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live,&quot;</i> was
a text, which at once (as they conceived) authorized their belief in
sorcery, and sanctioned the penalty which they denounced against it. The
Fairies were, therefore, in no better credit after the Reformation than
before, being still regarded as actual daemons, or something very little
better. A famous divine, Doctor Jasper Brokeman, teaches us, in his
system of divinity, &quot;that they inhabit in those places that are polluted
with any crying sin, as effusion of blood, or where unbelief or
superstitione have gotten the upper hand.&quot;&mdash;<i>Description of Feroe.</i> The
Fairies being on such bad terms with the divines, those, who pretended
to intercourse with them, were, without scruple, punished as sorcerers;
and such absurd charges are frequently stated as exaggerations of
crimes, in themselves sufficiently heinous.</p>

<p>Such is the case in the trial of the noted Major Weir, and his sister;
where the following mummery interlards a criminal indictment, too
infamously flagitious to be farther detailed: &quot;9th April, 1670. Jean
Weir, indicted of sorceries, committed by her when she lived and kept a
school at Dalkeith: that she took employment from a woman, to speak in
her behalf to the <i>Queen of Fairii, meaning the Devil</i>; and that another
woman gave her a piece of a tree, or root, the next day, and did tell
her, that as long as she kept the same, she should be able to do what
she pleased; and that same woman, from whom she got the tree, caused her
spread a cloth before her door, and set her foot upon it, and to repeat
thrice, in the posture foresaid, these words, <i>'All her losses and
crosses go alongst to the doors,'</i> which was truly a consulting with the
devil, and an act of sorcery, &amp;c. That after the spirit, in the shape of
a woman, who gave her the piece of tree, had removed, she, addressing
herself to spinning, and having spun but a short time, found more
yarn upon the pirn than could possibly have come there by good
means.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_A_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_47"><sup>[A]</sup></a>&mdash;<i>Books of Adjournal.</i></p>

<a name="Footnote_A_47"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_47">[A]</a><div class="note"><p> It is observed in the record, that Major Weir, a man of
the most vicious character, was at the same time ambitious of appearing
eminently godly; and used to frequent the beds of sick persons, to
assist them with his prayers. On such occasions, he put to his mouth
a long staff, which he usually carried, and expressed himself with
uncommon energy and fluency, of which he was utterly incapable when the
inspiring rod was withdrawn. This circumstance, the result, probably, of
a trick or habit, appearing suspicious to the judges, the staff of the
sorcerer was burned along with his person. One hundred and thirty years
have elapsed since his execution, yet no one has, during that space,
ventured to inhabit the house of this celebrated criminal.</p></div>

<p>Neither was the judgment of the criminal court of Scotland less severe
against another familiar of the Fairies, whose supposed correspondence
with the court of Elfland seems to have constituted the sole crime, for
which she was burned alive. Her name was Alison Pearson, and she seems
to have been a very noted person. In a bitter satire against Adamson,
Bishop of St Andrews, he is accused of consulting with sorcerers,
particularly with this very woman; and an account is given of her
travelling through Breadalbane, in the company of the Queen of Fa&euml;ry,
and of her descrying, in the court of Elfland, many persons, who had
been supposed at rest in the peaceful grave.<a name="FNanchor_A_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_48"><sup>[A]</sup></a> Among these we find two
remarkable personages; the secretary, young Maitland of Lethington, and
one of the old lairds of Buccleuch. The cause of their being stationed
in Elfland probably arose from the manner of their decease; which, being
uncommon and violent, caused the vulgar to suppose that they had been
abstracted by the Fairies. Lethington, as is generally supposed, died a
Roman death during his imprisonment in Leith; and the Buccleuch, whom I
believe to be here meant, was slain in a nocturnal scuffle by the Kerrs,
his hereditary enemies. Besides, they were both attached to the cause
of Queen Mary, and to the ancient religion; and were thence, probably,
considered as more immediately obnoxious to the assaults of the powers
of darkness.<a name="FNanchor_B_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_49"><sup>[B]</sup></a> The indictment of Alison Pearson notices her intercourse
with the Archbishop of St Andrews, and contains some particulars, worthy
of notice, regarding the court of Elfland. It runs thus: &quot;28th May,

consulting with evil spirits, in the form of one Mr William Simpsone,

medicine, that healed her of her diseases when she was twelve years of
age; having lost the power of her syde, and having a familiaritie with
him for divers years, dealing with charms, and abuseing the common
people by her arts of witchcraft, thir divers years by-past.</p>

<p>For this idle story the poor woman actually suffered death. Yet,
notwithstanding the fervent arguments thus liberally used by the
orthodox, the common people, though they dreaded even to think or speak
about the Fairies, by no means unanimously acquiesced in the doctrine,
which consigned them to eternal perdition. The inhabitants of the Isle
of Man call them the &quot;<i>good people</i>, and say they live in wilds, and
forests, and on mountains, and shun great cities, because of the
wickedness acted therein: all the houses are blessed where they visit,
for they fly vice. A person would be thought impudently prophane who
should suffer his family to go to bed, without having first set a tub,
or pail, full of clean water, for those guests to bathe themselves in,
which the natives aver they constantly do, as soon as ever the eyes of
the family are closed, wherever they vouchsafe to come.&quot;&mdash;WALDREN's
<i>Works</i>, p. 126. There are some curious, and perhaps anomalous facts,
concerning the history of Fairies, in a sort of Cock-lane narrative,
contained in a letter from Moses Pitt, to Dr Edward Fowler, Lord Bishop
of Gloucester, printed at London in 1696, and preserved in Morgan's
<i>Phoenix Britannicus,</i> 4to, London 1732.</p>

<p>Anne Jefferies was born in the parish of St Teath, in the county of
Cornwall, in 1626. Being the daughter of a poor man, she resided as
servant in the house of the narrator's father, and waited upon the
narrator himself, in his childhood. As she was knitting stockings in an
arbour of the garden, &quot;six small people, all in green clothes,&quot; came
suddenly over the garden wall; at the sight of whom, being much
frightened, she was seized with convulsions, and continued so long sick,
that she became as a changeling, and was unable to walk. During her
sickness, she frequently exclaimed, &quot;They are just gone out of the
window! they are just gone out of the window! do you not see them?&quot;
These expressions, as she afterwards declared, related to their
disappearing. During the harvest, when every one was employed, her
mistress walked out; and dreading that Anne, who was extremely weak
and silly, might injure herself, or the house, by the fire, with some
difficulty persuaded her to walk in the orchard till her return. She
accidentally hurt her leg, and, at her return, Anne cured it, by
stroking it with her hand. She appeared to be informed of every
particular, and asserted, that she had this information from the
Fairies, who had caused the misfortune. After this, she performed
numerous cures, but would never receive money for them. From harvest
time to Christmas, she was fed by the Fairies, and eat no other victuals
but theirs. The narrator affirms, that, looking one day through the
key-hole of the door of her chamber, he saw her eating; and that she
gave him a piece of bread, which was the most delicious he ever tasted.
The Fairies always appeared to her in even numbers; never less than two,
nor more than eight, at a time. She had always a sufficient stock of
salves and medicines, and yet neither made, nor purchased any; nor did
she ever appear to be in want of money. She, one day, gave a silver cup,
containing about a quart, to the daughter of her mistress, a girl about
four years old, to carry to her mother, who refused to receive it. The
narrator adds, that he had seen her dancing in the orchard among the
trees, and that she informed him she was then dancing with the Fairies.
The report of the strange cures which she performed, soon attracted the
attention of both ministers and magistrates. The ministers endeavoured
to persuade her, that the Fairies by which she was haunted, were evil
spirits, and that she was under the delusion of the devil. After they
had left her, she was visited by the Fairies, while in great perplexity;
who desired her to cause those, who termed them evil spirits, to
read that place of scripture, <i>First Epistle of John,</i>, chap. iv. v.
1,&mdash;<i>Dearly beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits,
whether they are of God,</i> &amp;c. Though Anne Jefferies could not read, she
produced a Bible folded down at this passage. By the magistrates she was
confined three months, without food, in Bodmin jail, and afterwards
for some time in the house of Justice Tregeagle. Before the constable
appeared to apprehend her, she was visited by the Fairies, who informed
her what was intended, and advised her to go with him. When this account
was given, on May 1, 1696, she was still alive; but refused to relate
any particulars of her connection with the Fairies, or the occasion on
which they deserted her, lest she should again fall under the cognizance
of the magistrates.</p>

<p>Anne Jefferies' Fairies were not altogether singular in maintaining
their good character, in opposition to the received opinion of the
church. Aubrey and Lily, unquestionably judges in such matters, had
a high opinion of these beings, if we may judge from the following
succinct and business-like memorandum of a ghost-seer. &quot;Anno 1670. Not
far from Cirencester was an apparition. Being demanded whether a good
spirit or a bad, returned no answer, but disappeared with a curious
perfume, and most melodious twang. M.W. Lilly believes it was a Fairie.

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">AUBREY'S <i>Miscellanies,</i> p. 80.</span><br>

<p>A rustic, also, whom Jackson taxed with magical practices, about 1620,
obstinately denied that the good King of the Fairies had any connection
with the devil; and some of the Highland seers, even in our day,
have boasted of their intimacy with the elves, as an innocent and
advantageous connection. One Maccoan, in Appin, the last person
eminently gifted with the second sight, professed to my learned and
excellent friend, Mr Ramsay, of Ochtertyre, that he owed his prophetic
visions to their intervention.</p>

<p>VI. There remains yet another cause to be noticed, which seems to have
induced a considerable alteration into the popular creed of England,
respecting Fairies. Many poets of the sixteenth century, and, above all,
our immortal Shakespeare, deserting the hackneyed fictions of Greece and
Rome, sought for machinery in the superstitions of their native country.
&quot;The fays, which nightly dance upon the wold,&quot; were an interesting
subject; and the creative imagination of the bard, improving upon the
vulgar belief, assigned to them many of those fanciful attributes and
occupations, which posterity have since associated with the name
of Fairy. In such employments, as rearing the drooping flower, and
arranging the disordered chamber, the Fairies of South Britain gradually
lost the harsher character of the dwarfs, or elves. Their choral dances
were enlivened by the introduction of the merry goblin <i>Puck</i>,<a name="FNanchor_A_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_53"><sup>[A]</sup></a>
for whose freakish pranks they exchanged their original mischievous
propensities. The Fairies of Shakespeare, Drayton, and Mennis,
therefore, at first exquisite fancy portraits, may be considered as
having finally operated a change in the original which gave them
birth.<a name="FNanchor_B_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_54"><sup>[B]</sup></a></p>

<a name="Footnote_A_53"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_53">[A]</a><div class="note"><p> Robin Goodfellow, or Hobgoblin, possesses the frolicksome
qualities of the French <i>Lutin</i>. For his full character, the reader is

<a name="Footnote_B_54"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_54">[B]</a><div class="note"><p> The Fairy land, and Fairies of Spenser, have no connection
with popular superstition, being only words used to denote an Utopian
scene of action, and imaginary or allegorical characters; and the title
of the &quot;Fairy Queen&quot; being probably suggested by the elfin mistress of
Chaucer's <i>Sir Thopas</i>. The stealing of the Red Cross Knight, while a
child, is the only incident in the poem which approaches to the popular
character of the Fairy:
</p><p><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&mdash;A Fairy thee unweeting reft;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There as thou sleptst in tender swadling band,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And her base elfin brood there for thee left:</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Such men do changelings call, so chang'd by Fairies theft.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Book I. Canto</i> 10.</span></p></div><br>

<p>While the fays of South Britain received such attractive and poetical
embellishments, those of Scotland, who possessed no such advantage,
retained more of their ancient, and appropriate character. Perhaps,
also, the persecution which these sylvan deities underwent, at the
instance of the stricter presbyterian clergy, had its usual effect, in
hardening their dispositions, or at least in rendering them more dreaded
by those among whom they dwelt. The face of the country, too, might
have some effect; as we should naturally attribute a less malicious
disposition, and a less frightful appearance, to the fays who glide by
moon-light through the oaks of Windsor, than to those who haunt the
solitary heaths and lofty mountains of the North. The fact at least is
certain; and it has not escaped a late ingenious traveller, that the
character of the Scottish Fairy is more harsh and terrific than that
which is ascribed to the elves of our sister kingdom.&mdash;See STODDART'S
<i>View of Scenery and Manners in Scotland.</i></p>

<p>The Fairies of Scotland are represented as a diminutive race of beings,
of a mixed, or rather dubious nature, capricious in their dispositions,
and mischievous in their resentment. They inhabit the interior of green
hills, chiefly those of a conical form, in Gaelic termed <i>Sighan</i>, on
which they lead their dances by moon-light; impressing upon the surface
the mark of circles, which sometimes appear yellow and blasted,
sometimes of a deep green hue; and within which it is dangerous to
sleep, or to be found after sun-set. The removal of those large portions
of turf, which thunderbolts sometimes scoop out of the ground with
singular regularity, is also ascribed to their agency. Cattle, which are
suddenly seized with the cramp, or some similar disorder, are said to be
<i>elf-shot</i>; and the approved cure is, to chafe the parts affected with
a blue bonnet, which, it may be readily believed, often restores the
circulation. The triangular flints, frequently found in Scotland, with
which the ancient inhabitants probably barbed their shafts, are supposed
to be the weapons of Fairy resentment, and are termed <i>elf-arrow heads</i>.
The rude brazen battle-axes of the ancients, commonly called <i>celts</i>,
are also ascribed to their manufacture. But, like the Gothic duergar,
their skill is not confined to the fabrication of arms; for they are
heard sedulously hammering in linns, precipices, and rocky or cavernous
situations where, like the dwarfs of the mines, mentioned by Georg.
Agricola, they busy themselves in imitating the actions and the various
employments of men. The brook of Beaumont, for example, which passes,
in its course, by numerous linns and caverns, is notorious for being
haunted by the Fairies; and the perforated and rounded stones, which are
formed by trituration in its channel, are termed, by the vulgar, fairy
cups and dishes. A beautiful reason is assigned, by Fletcher, for the
fays frequenting streams and fountains. He tells us of</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A virtuous well, about whose flowery banks</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The nimble-footed Fairies dance their rounds,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By the pale moon-shine, dipping oftentimes</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their stolen children, so to make them free</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From dying flesh, and dull mortality.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Faithful Shepherdess.</i></span><br>

<p>It is sometimes accounted unlucky to pass such places, without
performing some ceremony to avert the displeasure of the elves. There
is, upon the top of Minchmuir, a mountain in Peebles-shire, a spring,
called the <i>Cheese Well</i>, because, anciently, those who passed that way
were wont to throw into it a piece of cheese, as an offering to the
Fairies, to whom it was consecrated.</p>

<p>Like the <i>feld elfen</i> of the Saxons, the usual dress of the Fairies
is green; though, on the moors, they have been sometimes observed in
heath-brown, or in weeds dyed with the stoneraw, or lichen.<a name="FNanchor_A_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_55"><sup>[A]</sup></a> They
often ride in invisible procession, when their presence is discovered by
the shrill ringing of their bridles. On these occasions, they sometimes
borrow mortal steeds; and when such are found at morning, panting and
fatigued in their stalls, with their manes and tails dishevelled and
entangled, the grooms, I presume, often find this a convenient excuse
for their situation; as the common belief of the elves quaffing the
choicest liquors in the cellars of the rich (see the story of Lord
Duffus below), might occasionally cloak the delinquencies of an
unfaithful butler.</p>

<a name="Footnote_A_55"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_55">[A]</a><div class="note"><p> Hence the hero of the ballad is termed an &quot;elfin grey.&quot;</p></div>

<p>The Fairies, beside their equestrian processions, are addicted it would
seem, to the pleasures of the chace. A young sailor, travelling by night
from Douglas, in the Isle of Man, to visit his sister, residing in Kirk
Merlugh, heard the noise of horses, the holla of a huntsman, and the
sound of a horn. Immediately afterwards, thirteen horsemen, dressed in
green, and gallantly mounted, swept past him. Jack was so much delighted
with the sport, that he followed them, and enjoyed the sound of the horn
for some miles; and it was not till he arrived at his sister's house
that he learned the danger which he had incurred. I must not omit to
mention, that these little personages are expert jockeys, and scorn to
ride the little Manks ponies, though apparently well suited to their
size. The exercise therefore, falls heavily upon the English and Irish
horses brought into the Isle of Man. Mr Waldron was assured by a
gentleman of Ballafletcher, that he had lost three or four capital
hunters by these nocturnal excursions.&mdash;WALDRON'S <i>Works</i>, p. 132.
From the same author we learn, that the Fairies sometimes take more
legitimate modes of procuring horses. A person of the utmost integrity
informed him, that, having occasion to sell a horse, he was accosted
among the mountains by a little gentleman plainly dressed, who priced
his horse, cheapened him, and, after some chaffering, finally purchased
him. No sooner had the buyer mounted, and paid the price, than, he sunk
through the earth, horse and man, to the astonishment and terror of the
seller; who experienced, however, no inconvenience from dealing with so
extraordinary a purchaser.&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i> p. 135.</p>

<p>It is hoped the reader will receive, with due respect, these, and
similar stories, told by Mr Waldron; for he himself, a scholar and a
gentleman, informs us, &quot;as to circles in grass, and the impression
of small feet among the snow, I cannot deny but I have seen them
frequently, and once thought I heard a whistle, as though in my ear,
when nobody that could make it was near me.&quot; In this passage there is a
curious picture of the contagious effects of a superstitious atmosphere.
Waldron had lived so long among the Manks, that he was almost persuaded
to believe their legends.</p>

<p>From the <i>History of the Irish Bards</i>, by Mr Walker, and from the
glossary subjoined to the lively and ingenious <i>Tale of Castle
Rackrent</i>, we learn, that the same ideas, concerning Fairies, are
current among the vulgar in that country. The latter authority mentions
their inhabiting the ancient tumuli, called <i>Barrows</i>, and their
abstracting mortals. They are termed &quot;the good people;&quot; and when an eddy
of wind raises loose dust and sand, the vulgar believe that it announces
a Fairy procession, and bid God speed their journey.</p>

<p>The Scottish Fairies, in like manner, sometimes reside in subterranean
abodes, in the vicinity of human habitations or, according to the
popular phrase, under the &quot;door-stane,&quot; or threshold; in which
situation, they sometimes establish an intercourse with men, by
borrowing and lending, and other kindly offices. In this capacity they
are termed &quot;the good neighbours,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_A_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_56"><sup>[A]</sup></a> from supplying privately the wants
of their friends, and assisting them in all their transactions, while
their favours are concealed. Of this the traditionary story of Sir
Godfrey Macculloch forms a curious example.</p>

<a name="Footnote_A_56"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_56">[A]</a><div class="note"><p> Perhaps this epithet is only one example, among many, of
the extreme civility which the vulgar in Scotland use towards spirits of
a, dubious, or even a determinedly mischievous, nature. The archfiend
himself is often distinguished by the softened title of the &quot;good-man.&quot;
This epithet, so applied, must sound strange to a southern ear; but, as
the phrase bears various interpretations, according to the places where
it is used, so, in the Scottish dialect, the <i>good-man of such a place</i>
signifies the tenant, or life-renter, in opposition to the laird, or
proprietor. Hence, the devil is termed the good-man, or tenant, of the
infernal regions. In the book of the Universal Kirk, 13th May, 1594,
mention is made of &quot;the horrible superstitioune usit in Garioch, and
dyvers parts of the countrie, in not labouring a parcel of ground
dedicated to the devil, under the title of the <i>Guid-man's Croft</i>.&quot; Lord
Hailes conjectured this to have been the <i>tenenos</i> adjoining to some
ancient Pagan temple. The unavowed, but obvious, purpose of this
practice, was to avert the destructive rage of Satan from the
neighbouring possessions. It required various fulminations of the
General Assembly of the Kirk to abolish a practice bordering so nearly
upon the doctrine of the Magi.</p></div>

<p>As this Gallovidian gentleman was taking the air on horseback, near his
own house, he was suddenly accosted by a little old man, arrayed in
green, and mounted upon a white palfrey. After mutual salutation, the
old man gave Sir Godfrey to understand, that he resided under his
habitation, and that he had great reason to complain of the direction of
a drain, or common sewer, which emptied itself directly into his chamber
of dais, <a name="FNanchor_A_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_57"><sup>[A]</sup></a> Sir Godfrey Macculloch was a good deal startled at this
extraordinary complaint; but, guessing the nature of the being he had
to deal with, he assured the old man, with great courtesy, that the
direction of the drain should be altered; and caused it be done
accordingly. Many years afterwards, Sir Godfrey had the misfortune to
kill, in a fray, a gentleman of the neighbourhood. He was apprehended,
tried, and condemned.<a name="FNanchor_B_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_58"><sup>[B]</sup></a> The scaffold, upon which his head was to be
struck off, was erected on the Castle-hill of Edinburgh; but hardly had
he reached the fatal spot, when the old man, upon his white palfrey,
pressed through the crowd, with the rapidity of lightning. Sir Godfrey,
at his command, sprung on behind him; the &quot;good neighbour&quot; spurred his
horse down the steep bank, and neither he nor the criminal were ever
again seen.</p>

<a name="Footnote_A_57"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_57">[A]</a><div class="note"><p> The best chamber was thus currently denominated in
Scotland, from the French <i>dais</i>, signifying that part of the ancient
halls which was elevated above the rest, and covered with a canopy.
The turf-seats, which occupy the sunny side of a cottage wall, is also
termed the <i>dais</i>.</p></div>

<a name="Footnote_B_58"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_58">[B]</a><div class="note"><p> In this particular, tradition coincides with the real fact;

<p>The most formidable attribute of the elves, was their practice of
carrying away, and exchanging, children; and that of stealing human
souls from their bodies. &quot;A persuasion prevails among the ignorant,&quot;
says the author of a MS. history of Moray, &quot;that, in a consumptive
disease, the Fairies steal away the soul, and put the soul of a Fairy in
the room of it.&quot; This belief prevails chiefly along the eastern coast of
Scotland, where a practice, apparently of druidical origin, is used to
avert the danger. In the increase of the March moon, withies of oak and
ivy are cut, and twisted into wreaths or circles, which they preserve
till next March. After that period, when persons are consumptive, or
children hectic, they cause them to pass thrice through these circles.
In other cases the cure was more rough, and at least as dangerous as the
disease, as will appear from the following extract:</p>

<p>&quot;There is one thing remarkable in this parish of Suddie (in
Inverness-shire), which I think proper to mention. There is a small hill
N.W. from the church, commonly called Therdy Hill, or Hill of Therdie,
as some term it; on the top of which there is a well, which I had the
curiosity to view, because of the several reports concerning it. When
children happen to be sick, and languish long in their malady, so that
they almost turned skeletons, the common people imagine they are taken
away (at least the substance) by spirits, called Fairies, and the shadow
left with them; so, at a particular season in summer, they leave them
all night themselves, watching at a distance, near this well, and this
they imagine will either <i>end or mend them</i>; they say many more do
recover than do not. Yea, an honest tenant who lives hard by it, and
whom I had the curiosity to discourse about it, told me it has recovered
some, who were about eight or nine years of age, and to his certain
knowledge they bring adult persons to it; for, as he was passing one
dark night, he heard groanings, and coming to the well, he found a man,
who had been long sick, wrapped in a plaid, so that he could scarcely
move, a stake being fixed in the earth, with a rope, or tedder, that was
about the plaid; he had no sooner enquired what he was, but he conjured
him to loose him, and out of sympathy he was pleased to slacken that,
wherein he was, as I may so speak, swaddled; but, if I right remember,
he signified, he did not recover.&quot;&mdash;<i>Account of the Parish of Suddie,</i>
apud <i>Macfarlane's MSS.</i></p>

<p>According to the earlier doctrine, concerning the original corruption of
human nature, the power of daemons over infants had been long reckoned
considerable, in the period intervening between birth and baptism.
During this period, therefore, children were believed to be particularly
liable to abstraction by the Fairies, and mothers chiefly dreaded the
substitution of changelings in the place of their own offspring. Various
monstrous charms existed in Scotland, for procuring the restoration of a
child, which had been thus stolen; but the most efficacious of them was
supposed to be, the roasting of the suppositious child upon the live
embers, when it was believed it would vanish, and the true child appear
in the place, whence it had been originally abstracted.<a name="FNanchor_A_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_59"><sup>[A]</sup></a></p>

<a name="Footnote_A_59"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_59">[A]</a><div class="note"><p> Less perilous recipes were sometimes used. The editor is
possessed of a small relique, termed by tradition a toad-stone, the
influence of which was supposed to preserve pregnant women from the
power of daemons, and other dangers incidental to their situation. It
has been carefully preserved for several generations, was often pledged
for considerable sums of money, and uniformly redeemed, from a belief in
its efficacy.</p></div>

<p>The most minute and authenticated account of an exchanged child is to be
found in Waldron's <i>Isle of Man</i>, a book from which I have derived much
legendary information. &quot;I was prevailed upon myself,&quot; says that author,
&quot;to go and see a child, who, they told me, was one of these changelings,
and, indeed, must own, was not a little surprised, as well as shocked,
at the sight. Nothing under heaven could have a more beautiful face;
but, though between five and six years old, and seemingly healthy, he
was so far from being able to walk or stand, that he could not so much
as move any one joint; his limbs were vastly long for his age, but
smaller than any infant's of six months; his complexion was perfectly
delicate, and he had the finest hair in the world. He never spoke nor
cried, ate scarce any thing, and was very seldom seen to smile; but if
any one called him a <i>fairy-elf</i>, he would frown, and fix his eyes so
earnestly on those who said it, as if he would look them through. His
mother, or at least his supposed mother, being very poor, frequently
went out a chareing, and left him a whole day together. The neighbours,
out of curiosity, have often looked in at the window, to see how he
behaved while alone; which, whenever they did, they were sure to find
him laughing, and in the utmost delight. This made them judge that he
was not without company, more pleasing to him than any mortals could be;
and what made this conjecture seem the more reasonable, was, that if he
were left ever so dirty, the woman, at her return, saw him with a clean
face, and his hair combed with the utmost exactness and nicety.&quot; P. 128.</p>

<p>Waldron gives another account of a poor woman, to whose offspring, it
would seem, the Fairies had taken a special fancy. A few nights after
she was delivered of her first child, the family were alarmed by a
dreadful cry of &quot;Fire!&quot; All flew to the door, while the mother lay
trembling in bed, unable to protect her infant, which was snatched from
the bed by an invisible hand. Fortunately the return of the gossips,
after the causeless alarm, disturbed the Fairies, who dropped the child,
which was found sprawling and shrieking upon the threshold. At the good
woman's second <i>accouchement</i>, a tumult was heard in the cow-house,
which drew thither the whole assistants. They returned, when they found
that all was quiet among the cattle, and lo! the second child had been
carried from the bed, and dropped in the middle of the lane. But, upon
the third occurrence of the same kind, the company were again decoyed
out of the sick woman's chamber by a false alarm, leaving only a nurse,
who was detained by the bonds of sleep. On this last occasion, the
mother plainly saw her child removed, though the means were invisible.
She screamed for assistance to the nurse; but the old lady had partaken
too deeply of the cordials which circulate on such joyful occasions, to
be easily awakened. In short, the child was this time fairly carried
off, and a withered, deformed creature, left in its stead, quite naked,
with the clothes of the abstracted infant, rolled in a bundle, by its
side. This creature lived nine years, ate nothing but a few herbs,
and neither spoke, stood, walked nor performed any other functions
of mortality; resembling, in all respects, the changeling already
mentioned.&mdash;WALDRON'S <i>Works, ibid.</i></p>

<p>But the power of the Fairies was not confined to unchristened children
alone; it was supposed frequently to extend to full grown persons,
especially such as, in an unlucky hour, were devoted to the devil by the
execration of parents, and of masters;<a name="FNanchor_A_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_60"><sup>[A]</sup></a> or those who were found asleep
under a rock, or on a green hill, belonging to the Fairies, after
sun-set; or, finally, to those who unwarily joined their orgies. A
tradition existed, during the seventeenth century, concerning an
ancestor of the noble family of Duffus, who, &quot;walking abroad in the
fields, near to his own house, was suddenly carried away, and found the
next day at Paris, in the French king's cellar, with a silver cup in his
hand. Being brought into the king's presence, and questioned by him who
he was, and how he came thither, he told his name, his country, and the
place of his residence; and that, on such a day of the month, which
proved to be the day immediately preceding, being in the fields, he
heard the noise of a whirlwind, and of voices, crying, <i>'Horse and
Hattock!'</i> (this is the word which the Fairies are said to use when they
remove from any place), whereupon he cried, <i>'Horse and Hattock'</i> also,
and was immediately caught up, and transported through the air, by the
Fairies, to that place, where, after he had drunk heartily, he fell
asleep, and, before he woke, the rest of the company were gone, and had
left him in the posture wherein he was found. It is said the king gave
him the cup, which was found in his hand, and dismissed him.&quot; The
narrator affirms, &quot;that the cup was still preserved, and known by the
name of the <i>Fairy cup</i>.&quot; He adds, that Mr Steward, tutor to the then
Lord Duffus, had informed him, &quot;that, when a boy, at the school of
Forres, he, and his school-fellows, were upon a time whipping their tops
in the church-yard, before the door of the church, when, though the day
was calm, they heard a noise of a wind, and at some distance saw
the small dust begin to rise and turn round, which motion continued
advancing till it came to the place where they were, whereupon they
began to bless themselves; but one of their number being, it seems, a
little more bold and confident than his companions, said, <i>'Horse and
Hattock, with my top,'</i> and immediately they all saw the top lifted up
from the ground, but could not see which way it was carried, by reason
of a cloud of dust which was raised at the same time. They sought for
the top all about the place where it was taken up, but in vain; and
it was found afterwards in the church-yard, on the other side of the
church.&quot;&mdash;This puerile legend is contained in a letter from a learned
gentleman in Scotland, to Mr Aubrey, dated 15th March, 1695, published
in AUBREY'S <i>Miscellanies,</i> p. 158.</p>

<a name="Footnote_A_60"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_60">[A]</a><div class="note"><p> This idea is not peculiar to the Gothic tribes, but extends
to those of Sclavic origin. Tooke (<i>History of Russia,</i> Vol. I. p.
100) relates, that the Russian peasants believe the nocturnal daemon,
<i>Kikimora</i>, to have been a child, whom the devil stole out of the womb
of its mother, because she had cursed it. They also assert, that if
an execration against a child be spoken in an evil hour, the child is
carried off by the devil. The beings, so stolen, are neither fiends nor
men; they are invisible, and afraid of the cross and holy water; but, on
the other hand, in their nature and dispositions they resemble mankind,
whom they love, and rarely injure.</p></div>

<p>Notwithstanding the special example of Lord Duffus, and of the top, it
is the common opinion, that persons, falling under the power of the
Fairies, were only allowed to revisit the haunts of men, after
seven years had expired. At the end of seven years more, they again
disappeared, after which they were seldom seen among mortals. The
accounts they gave of their situation, differ in some particulars.
Sometimes they were represented as leading a life of constant
restlessness, and wandering by moon-light. According to others, they
inhabited a pleasant region, where, however, their situation was
rendered horrible, by the sacrifice of one or more individuals to the
devil, every seventh year. This circumstance is mentioned in Alison
Pearson's indictment, and in the <i>Tale of the Young Tamlane,</i> where
it is termed, &quot;the paying the kane to hell,&quot; or, according to some
recitations, &quot;the teind,&quot; or tenth. This is the popular reason assigned
for the desire of the Fairies to abstract young children, as substitutes
for themselves in this dreadful tribute. Concerning the mode of winning,
or recovering, persons abstracted by the Fairies, tradition differs; but
the popular opinion, contrary to what may be inferred from the following
tale, supposes, that the recovery must be effected within a year and a
day, to be held legal in the Fairy court. This feat, which was reckoned
an enterprize of equal difficulty and danger, could only be accomplished
on Hallowe'en, at the great annual procession of the Fairy court.<a name="FNanchor_A_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_61"><sup>[A]</sup></a>
Of this procession the following description is found in Montgomery's
<i>Flyting against Polwart,</i> apud <i>Watson's Collection of Scots Poems,</i>
1709, Part III. p. 12.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the hinder end of harvest, on All-hallowe'en,</span><br>

<p>The catastrophe of <i>Tamlane</i> terminated more successfully than that of
other attempts, which tradition still records. The wife of a farmer in
Lothian had been carried off by the Fairies, and, during the year of
probation, repeatedly appeared on Sunday, in the midst of her children,
combing their hair. On one of these occasions she was accosted by
her husband; when she related to him the unfortunate event which had
separated them, instructed him by what means he might win her, and
exhorted him to exert all his courage, since her temporal and eternal
happiness depended on the success of his attempt. The farmer, who
ardently loved his wife, set out on Hallow-e'en and, in the midst of a
plot of furze, waited impatiently for the procession of the Fairies. At
the ringing of the Fairy bridles, and the wild unearthly sound which
accompanied the cavalcade, his heart failed him, and he suffered the
ghostly train to pass by without interruption. When the last had rode
past, the whole troop vanished, with loud shouts of laughter and
exultation; among which he plainly discovered the voice of his wife,
lamenting that he had lost her for ever.</p>

<p>A similar, but real incident, took place at the town of North Berwick,
within the memory of man. The wife of a man, above the lowest class of
society, being left alone in the house, a few days after delivery, was
attacked and carried off by one of those convulsion fits, incident to
her situation. Upon the return of the family, who had been engaged in
hay-making, or harvest, they found the corpse much disfigured. This
circumstance, the natural consequence of her disease, led some of the
spectators to think that she had been carried off by the Fairies,
and that the body before them was some elfin deception. The husband,
probably, paid little attention to this opinion at the time. The body
was interred, and, after a decent time had elapsed, finding his domestic
affairs absolutely required female superintendence, the widower paid
his addresses to a young woman in the neighbourhood. The recollection,
however, of his former wife, whom he had tenderly loved, haunted his
slumbers; and, one morning, he came to the clergyman of the parish in
the utmost dismay, declaring, that she had appeared to him the preceding
night, informed him that she was a captive in Fairy Land, and conjured
him to attempt her deliverance. She directed him to bring the minister,
and certain other persons, whom she named, to her grave at midnight. Her
body was then to be dug up, and certain prayers recited; after which the
corpse was to become animated, and fly from them. One of the assistants,
the swiftest runner in the parish, was to pursue the body; and, if he
was able to seize it, before it had thrice encircled the church, the
rest were to come to his assistance, and detain it, in spite of the
struggles it should use, and the various shapes into which it might be
transformed. The redemption of the abstracted person was then to become
complete. The minister, a sensible man, argued with his parishioner upon
the indecency and absurdity of what was proposed, and dismissed him.
Next Sunday, the banns being for the first time proclaimed betwixt the
widower and his new bride, his former wife, very naturally, took the
opportunity of the following night to make him another visit, yet more
terrific than the former. She upbraided him with his incredulity, his
fickleness, and his want of affection; and, to convince him that her
appearance was no a&euml;rial illusion, she gave suck, in his presence, to
her youngest child. The man, under the greatest horror of mind, had
again recourse to the pastor; and his ghostly counsellor fell upon
an admirable expedient to console him. This was nothing less than
dispensing with the further solemnity of banns, and marrying him,
without an hour's delay, to the young woman to whom he was affianced;
after which no spectre again disturbed his repose.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;">

<p>Having concluded these general observations upon the Fairy superstition,
which, although minute, may not, I hope, be deemed altogether
uninteresting, I proceed to the more particular illustrations, relating
to the <i>Tale of the Young Tamlane.</i></p>

<p>The following ballad, still popular in Ettrick Forest, where the scene
is laid, is certainly of much greater antiquity than its phraseology,
gradually modernized as transmitted by tradition, would seem to denote.
The <i>Tale of the Young Tamlane</i> is mentioned in the <i>Complaynt of
Scotland;</i> and the air, to which it was chaunted, seems to have been
accommodated to a particular dance; for the dance of <i>Thorn of
Lynn</i>, another variation of <i>Thomalin</i>, likewise occurs in the same
performance. Like every popular subject, it seems to have been
frequently parodied; and a burlesque ballad, beginning</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Tom o' the Linn was a Scotsman born,&quot;</span><br>

<p>is still well known.</p>

<p>In a medley, contained in a curious and ancient MS. cantus, <i>penes</i> J.G.
Dalyell, Esq., there is an allusion to our ballad:&mdash;</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Sing young Thomlin, be merry, be merry, and twice so merry.&quot;</span><br>

<p>In <i>Scottish Songs</i>, 1774, a part of the original tale was published,
under the title of <i>Kerton Ha';</i> a corruption of Carterhaugh; and,
in the same collection, there is a fragment, containing two or three
additional verses, beginning,</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I'll wager, I'll wager, I'll wager with you,&quot; &amp;c.</span><br>

<p>In Johnson's <i>Musical Museum</i>, a more complete copy occurs, under the
title of <i>Thom Linn</i>, which, with some alterations was reprinted in the
<i>Tales of Wonder</i>.</p>

<p>The present edition is the most perfect which has yet appeared; being
prepared from a collation of the printed copies, with a very accurate
one in Glenriddell's MSS., and with several recitals from tradition.
Some verses are omitted in this edition, being ascertained to belong to
a separate ballad, which will be found in a subsequent part of the work.
In one recital only, the well known fragment of the <i>Wee, wee Man</i>,
was introduced, in the same measure with the rest of the poem. It was
retained in the first edition, but is now omitted; as the editor has
been favoured, by the learned Mr Ritson, with a copy of the original
poem, of which it is a detached fragment. The editor has been enabled to
add several verses of beauty and interest to this edition of <i>Tamlane</i>,
in consequence of a copy, obtained from a gentleman residing near
Langholm, which is said to be very ancient, though the diction is
somewhat of a modern cast. The manners of the Fairies are detailed at
considerable length, and in poetry of no common merit.</p>

<p>Carterhaugh is a plain, at the conflux of the Ettrick and Yarrow, in
Selkirkshire, about a mile above Selkirk, and two miles below Newark
Castle; a romantic ruin, which overhangs the Yarrow, and which is said
to have been the habitation of our heroine's father, though others place
his residence in the tower of Oakwood. The peasants point out, upon the
plain, those electrical rings, which vulgar credulity supposes to be
traces of the Fairy revels. Here, they say, were placed the stands of
milk, and of water, in which <i>Tamlane</i> was dipped, in order to effect
the disenchantment; and upon these spots, according to their mode of
expressing themselves, the grass will never grow. Miles Cross (perhaps a
corruption of Mary's Cross), where fair Janet waited the arrival of the
Fairy train, is said to have stood near the duke of Buccleuch's seat of
Bowhill, about half a mile from Carterhaugh. In no part of Scotland,
indeed, has the belief in Fairies maintained its ground with more
pertinacity than in Selkirkshire. The most sceptical among the lower
ranks only venture to assert, that their appearances, and mischievous
exploits, have ceased, or at least become infrequent, since the light of
the Gospel was diffused in its purity. One of their frolics is said to
have happened late in the last century. The victim of elfin sport was a
poor man, who, being employed in pulling heather upon Peatlaw, a hill
not far from Carterhaugh, had tired of his labour, and laid him down
to sleep upon a Fairy ring.&mdash;When he awakened, he was amazed to find
himself in the midst of a populous city, to which, as well as to the
means of his transportation, he was an utter stranger. His coat was left
upon the Peatlaw; and his bonnet, which had fallen off in the course of
his a&euml;rial journey, was afterwards found hanging upon the steeple of
the church of Lanark. The distress of the poor man was, in some degree,
relieved, by meeting a carrier, whom he had formerly known, and who
conducted him back to Selkirk, by a slower conveyance than had whirled
him to Glasgow.&mdash;That he had been carried off by the Fairies, was
implicitly believed by all, who did not reflect, that a man may have
private reasons for leaving his own country, and for disguising his
having intentionally done so.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But up then spak her, fair Janet,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The fairest o' a' her kin;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I'll cum and gang to Carterhaugh,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;And ask nae leave o' him.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Janet has kilted her green kirtle,<a name="FNanchor_A_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_62"><sup>[A]</sup></a></span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A little abune her knee;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A little abune her bree.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And when she cam to Carterhaugh,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">She gaed beside the well;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there she fand his steed standing,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But away was himsell.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She hadna pu'd a red red rose,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A rose but barely three;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till up and starts a wee wee man,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">At Lady Janet's knee.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Says&mdash;&quot;Why pu' ye the rose, Janet?</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;What gars ye break the tree?</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Or why come ye to Carterhaugh,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Amang the leaves sae green;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And what they did I cannot tell&mdash;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When she cam to her father's ha',</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">She looked pale and wan;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They thought she'd dried some sair sickness,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or been wi' some leman.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She didna comb her yellow hair,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nor make meikle o' her heid;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And ilka thing, that lady took,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Four and twenty ladies fair</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Were playing at the chess;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And out there came the fair Janet,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As green as any grass.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Out and spak an auld gray-headed knight,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lay o'er the castle wa'&mdash;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And ever alas! for thee, Janet,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;There's ne'er a knight about your ha'</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Shall hae the bairnie's name.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;'Twill prove a wondrous birth;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;For well I swear I'm not wi' bairn</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;To any man on earth.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;If my love were an earthly knight,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;As he's an elfin grey,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I wadna gie my ain true love</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To speak wi' young Tamlane.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And when she cam to Carterhaugh,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">She gaed beside the well;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there she saw the steed standing,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But away was himsell.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She hadna pu'd a double rose,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A rose but only twae,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When up and started young Tamlane,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Says&mdash;&quot;Lady, thou pu's nae mae!</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Why pu' ye the rose, Janet,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Within this garden grene,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And a' to kill the bonny babe,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;That we got us between?&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;The truth ye'll tell to me, Tamlane;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;A word ye mauna lie;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Gin ye're ye was in haly chapel,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Or sained<a name="FNanchor_B_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_63"><sup>[B]</sup></a> in Christentie.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;The truth I'll tell to thee, Janet,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;A word I winna lie;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;A knight me got, and a lady me bore,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;As well as they did thee.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Randolph, Earl Murray, was my sire,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Dunbar, Earl March, is thine;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;We loved when we were children small,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Which yet you well may mind.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;When I was a boy just turned of nine,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;My uncle sent for me,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;To hunt, and hawk, and ride with him,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;And keep him cumpanie.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;There came a wind out of the north,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;A sharp wind and a snell;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And a dead sleep came over me,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;And frae my horse I fell.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;The Queen of Fairies keppit me,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;In yon green hill to dwell;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And I'm a Fairy, lyth and limb;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Fair ladye, view me well.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But we, that live in Fairy-land,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;No sickness know, nor pain;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I quit my body when I will,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;And take to it again.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I quit my body when I please,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Or unto it repair;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;We can inhabit, at our ease,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;In either earth or air.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Our shapes and size we can convert,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;To either large or small;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;An old nut-shell's the same to us,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;As is the lofty hall.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;We sleep in rose-buds, soft and sweet,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;We revel in the stream;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;We wanton lightly on the wind,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Or glide on a sunbeam.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And all our wants are well supplied,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;From every rich man's store,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Who thankless sins the gifts he gets,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;And vainly grasps for more.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Then would I never tire, Janet,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;In elfish land to dwell;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But aye at every seven years,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;They pay the teind to hell;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And I am sae fat, and fair of flesh,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;I fear 'twill be mysell.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;This night is Hallowe'en, Janet,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;The morn is Hallowday;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And, gin ye dare your true love win,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Ye hae na time to stay.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;The night it is good Hallowe'en,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;When fairy folk will ride;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And they, that wad their true love win,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;At Miles Cross they maun bide.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But how shall I thee ken, Tamlane?</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Or how shall I thee knaw,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Amang so many unearthly knights,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;The like I never saw.?&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;The first company, that passes by,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Say na, and let them gae;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;The next company, that passes by,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Say na, and do right sae;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;The third company, that passes by,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Than I'll be ane o' thae.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;First let pass the black, Janet,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;And syne let pass the brown;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But grip ye to the milk-white steed,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;And pu' the rider down.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;For I ride on the milk-white steed,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;And ay nearest the town;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Because I was a christened knight,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;They gave me that renown.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;My right hand will be gloved, Janet,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;My left hand will be bare;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And these the tokens I gie thee,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Nae doubt I will be there.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;They'll turn me in your arms, Janet,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;An adder and a snake;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But had me fast, let me not pass,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Gin ye wad be my maik.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;They'll turn me in your arms, Janet,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;An adder and an ask;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;They'll turn me in your arms, Janet,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;A bale<a name="FNanchor_C_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_64"><sup>[C]</sup></a> that burns fast.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;They'll turn me in your arms, Janet,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;A red-hot gad o' aim;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But had me fast, let me not pass,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;For I'll do you no harm.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;First, dip me in a stand o' milk,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;And then in a stand o' water;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But had me fast, let me not pass&mdash;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;I'll be your bairn's father.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And, next, they'll shape me in your arms,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;A toad, but and an eel;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But had me fast, nor let me gang,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;As you do love me weel.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;They'll shape me in your arms, Janet,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;A dove, but and a swan;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And, last, they'll shape me in your arms,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;A mother-naked man:</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Cast your green mantle over me&mdash;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;I'll be mysell again.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gloomy, gloomy, was the night,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And eiry<a name="FNanchor_D_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_65"><sup>[D]</sup></a> was the way,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As fair Janet, in her green mantle,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To Miles Cross she did gae.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The heavens were black, the night was dark,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And dreary was the place;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But Janet stood, with eager wish,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Her lover to embrace.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Betwixt the hours of twelve and one,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A north wind tore the bent;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And straight she heard strange elritch sounds</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Upon that wind which went.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">About the dead hour o' the night,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">She heard the bridles ring;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Janet was as glad o' that,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As any earthly thing!</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their oaten pipes blew wondrous shrill,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The hemlock small blew clear;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And louder notes from hemlock large,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And bog-reed struck the ear;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But solemn sounds, or sober thoughts,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The Fairies cannot bear.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They sing, inspired with love and joy,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Like sky-larks in the air;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of solid sense, or thought that's grave,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">You'll find no traces there.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fair Janet stood, with mind unmoved,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The dreary heath upon;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And louder, louder, wax'd the sound,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As they came riding on.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will o' Wisp before them went,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sent forth a twinkling light;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And soon she saw the Fairy bands</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">All riding in her sight.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And first gaed by the black black steed,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And then gaed by the brown;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But fast she gript the milk-white steed,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And pu'd the rider down.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She pu'd him frae the milk-white steed,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And loot the bridle fa';</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And up there raise an erlish<a name="FNanchor_E_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_66"><sup>[E]</sup></a> cry&mdash;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;He's won amang us a'!&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They shaped him in fair Janet's arms,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">An esk<a name="FNanchor_F_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_67"><sup>[F]</sup></a>, but and an adder;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She held him fast in every shape&mdash;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To be her bairn's father.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They shaped him in her arms at last,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A mother-naked man;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She wrapt him in her green mantle,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And sae her true love wan.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Up then spake the Queen o' Fairies,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Out o' a bush o' broom&mdash;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;She that has borrowed young Tamlane,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Has gotten a stately groom.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Up then spake the Queen of Fairies,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Out o' a bush of rye&mdash;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;She's ta'en awa the bonniest knight</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In a' my cumpanie.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But had I kenn'd, Tamlane,&quot; she says,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;A lady wad borrowed thee&mdash;</span><br>

<p>NOTES ON THE YOUNG TAMLANE.</p>


<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Randolph, Earl Murray, was my sire,</i></span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Dunbar, Earl March, is thine,</i> &amp;c.&mdash;P. 185, v. 5.</span><br>

<p>Both these mighty chiefs were connected with Ettrick Forest, and its
vicinity. Their memory, therefore, lived in the traditions of the
country. Randolph, earl of Murray, the renowned nephew of Robert Bruce,
had a castle at Ha' Guards, in Annandale, and another in Peebles-shire,
on the borders of the forest, the site of which is still called
Randall's Walls. Patrick of Dunbar, earl of March, is said by Henry the
Minstrel, to have retreated to Ettrick Forest, after being defeated by
Wallace.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>And all our wants are well supplied,</i></span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>From every rich man's store;</i></span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Who thankless sins the gifts he gets, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;P. 187. v. 3.</span><br>

<p>To <i>sin our gifts, or mercies</i>, means, ungratefully to hold them in
slight esteem. The idea, that the possessions of the wicked are most
obnoxious to the depredations of evil spirits, may be illustrated by the
following tale of a <i>Buttery Spirit</i>, extracted from Thomas Heywood:&mdash;</p>

<p>An ancient and virtuous monk came to visit his nephew, an inn-keeper,
and, after other discourse, enquired into his circumstances. Mine host
confessed, that, although he practised all the unconscionable tricks of
his trade, he was still miserably poor. The monk shook his head, and
asked to see his buttery, or larder. As they looked into it, he rendered
visible to the astonished host an immense goblin, whose paunch,
and whole appearance, bespoke his being gorged with food, and who,
nevertheless, was gormandizing at the innkeeper's expence, emptying
whole shelves of food, and washing it down with entire hogsheads of
liquor. &quot;To the depredation of this visitor will thy viands be exposed,&quot;
quoth the uncle, &quot;until thou shalt abandon fraud, and false reckonings.&quot;
The monk returned in a year. The host having turned over a new leaf, and
given christian measure to his customers, was now a thriving man. When
they again inspected the larder, they saw the same spirit, but woefully
reduced in size, and in vain attempting to reach at the full plates and
bottles, which stood around him; starving, in short, like Tantalus, in
the midst of plenty. Honest Heywood sums up the tale thus:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In this discourse, far be it we should mean</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Spirits by meat are fatted made, or lean;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet certain 'tis, by God's permission, they</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">May, over goods extorted, bear like sway.</span><br>

<hr style="width: 45%;"><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All such as study fraud, and practise evil,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Do only starve themselves to plumpe the devill.</span><br>

<p>ERLINTON. NEVER BEFORE PUBLISHED.</p>
<br>

<p>This ballad is published from the collation of two copies, obtained from
recitation. It seems to be the rude original, or perhaps a corrupted
and imperfect copy, of <i>The Child of Elle</i>, a beautiful legendary tale,
published in the <i>Reliques of Ancient Poetry</i>. It is singular, that
this charming ballad should have been translated, or imitated, by the
celebrated B&uuml;rger, without acknowledgment of the English original. As
<i>The Child of Elle</i> avowedly received corrections, we may ascribe its
greatest beauties to the poetical taste of the ingenious editor. They
are in the truest stile of Gothic embellishment. We may compare, for
example, the following beautiful verse, with the same idea in an old
romance:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The baron stroked his dark-brown cheek,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And turned his face aside,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To wipe away the starting tear,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He proudly strove to hide!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Child of Elle.</i></span><br>

<p>The heathen Soldan, or Amiral, when about to slay two lovers, relents in
a similar manner:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Weeping, he turned his heued awai,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And his swerde hit fel to grounde.</span><br>

<p>THE TWA CORBIES.</p>
<br>

<p>This poem was communicated to me by Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, Esq.
jun. of Hoddom, as written down, from tradition, by a lady. It is a
singular circumstance, that it should coincide so very nearly with the
ancient dirge, called <i>The Three Ravens</i>, published by Mr Ritson, in his
<i>Ancient Songs;</i> and that, at the same time, there should exist such a
difference, as to make the one appear rather a counterpart than copy of
the other. In order to enable the curious reader to contrast these two
singular poems, and to form a judgment which may be the original, I take
the liberty of copying the English ballad from Mr Ritson's Collection,
omitting only the burden and repetition of the first line. The learned
editor states it to be given <i>&quot;From Ravencroft's Metismata. Musical
phansies, fitting the cittie and country, humours to 3, 4, and 5
voyces,</i> London, 1611, 4to. It will be obvious (continues Mr Ritson)
that this ballad is much older, not only than the date of the book, but
most of the other pieces contained in it.&quot; The music is given with the
words, and is adapted to four voices:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There were three rauens sat on a tre,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They were as blacke as they might be:</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The one of them said to his mate,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Where shall we our breakfast take?&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Downe in yonder greene field,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;There lies a knight slain under his shield;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;His hounds they lie downe at his feete,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;So well they their master keepe;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;His haukes they flie so eagerly,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;There's no fowle dare come him nie.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Down there comes a fallow doe,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;As great with yong as she might goe,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;She lift up his bloudy hed,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And kist his wounds that were so red.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;She got him up upon her backe,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And carried him to earthen lake.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;She buried him before the prime,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;She was dead her selfe ere euen song time.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;God send euery gentleman,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Such haukes, such houndes, and such a leman.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The tane unto the t'other say,</span><br>

<p>THE DOUGLAS TRAGEDY.</p>
<br>

<p>The ballad of <i>The Douglas Tragedy</i> is one of the few, to which popular
tradition has ascribed complete locality. The farm of Blackhouse, in
Selkirkshire, is said to have been the scene of this melancholy
event. There are the remains of a very ancient tower, adjacent to
the farmhouse, in a wild and solitary glen, upon a torrent, named
Douglas-burn, which joins the Yarrow, after passing a craggy rock,
called the Douglas-craig. This wild scene, now a part of the Traquair
estate, formed one of the most ancient possessions of the renowned
family of Douglas; for Sir John Douglas, eldest son of William,
the first Lord Douglas, is said to have sat, as baronial lord of
Douglas-burn, during his father's lifetime, in a parliament of Malcolm
Canmore, held at Forfar.&mdash;GODSCROFT, Vol. I. p. 20. The tower appears to
have been square, with a circular turret at one angle, for carrying up
the staircase, and for flanking the entrance. It is said to have derived
its name of Blackhouse from the complexion of the lords of Douglas,
whose swarthy hue was a family attribute. But, when the high mountains,
by which it is inclosed, were covered with heather, which was the case
till of late years, Blackhouse must have also merited its appellation
from the appearance of the scenery.</p>

<p>From this ancient tower Lady Margaret is said to have been carried by
her lover. Seven large stones, erected upon the neighbouring heights of
Blackhouse, are shown, as marking the spot where the seven brethren were
slain; and the Douglas-burn is averred to have been the stream, at which
the lovers stopped to drink: so minute is tradition in ascertaining the
scene of a tragical tale, which, considering the rude state of former
times, had probably foundation in some real event.</p>

<p>Many copies of this ballad are current among the vulgar, but chiefly in
a state of great corruption; especially such as have been committed to
the press in the shape of penny pamphlets. One of these is now before
me, which, among many others, has the ridiculous error of &quot;<i>blue gilded</i>
horn,&quot; for &quot;<i>bugelet</i> horn.&quot; The copy, principally used in this edition
of the ballad, was supplied by Mr Sharpe. The three last verses are
given from the printed copy, and from tradition. The hackneyed verse, of
the rose and the briar springing from the grave of the lovers, is common
to most tragic ballads; but it is introduced into this with singular
propriety, as the chapel of St Mary, whose vestiges may be still traced
upon the lake, to which it has given name, is said to have been the
burial place of Lord William and Fair Margaret. The wrath of the Black
Douglas, which vented itself upon the brier, far surpasses the usual
stanza:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At length came the clerk of the parish,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As you the truth shall hear,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And by mischance he cut them down,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or else they had still been there.</span><br>

<br>

<p>THE DOUGLAS TRAGEDY.</p>


<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Rise up, rise up, now, Lord Douglas,&quot; she says,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;And put on your armour so bright;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Let it never be said, that a daughter of thine</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Was married to a lord under night.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Rise up, rise up, my seven bold sons,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;And put on your armour so bright,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And take better care of your youngest sister,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;For your eldest's awa the last night.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He's mounted her on a milk-white steed,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And himself on a dapple grey,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a bugelet horn hung down by his side,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And lightly they rode away.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lord William lookit o'er his left shoulder,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To see what he could see,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there he spy'd her seven brethren bold</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Come riding over the lee.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Light down, light down, Lady Marg'ret,&quot; he said,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;And hold my steed in your hand,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Until that against your seven brethren bold,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;And your father, I mak a stand.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She held his steed in her milk-white hand,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And never shed one tear,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Until that she saw her seven brethren fa',</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And her father hard fighting, who lov'd her so dear.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;O hold your hand, Lord William!&quot; she said,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;For your strokes they are wond'rous sair;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;True lovers I can get many a ane,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;But a father I can never get mair.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O she's ta'en out her handkerchief,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">It was o' the holland sae fine,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And ay she dighted her father's bloody wounds,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That ware redder than the wine.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;O chuse, O chuse, Lady Marg'ret,&quot; he said,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;O whether will ye gang or bide?&quot;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I'll gang, I'll gang, Lord William,&quot; she said,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;For ye have left me no other guide.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He's lifted her on a milk-white steed,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And himself on a dapple grey,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a bugelet horn hung down by his side,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And slowly they baith rade away.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O they rade on, and on they rade,</span><br>

<p>YOUNG BENJIE. NEVER BEFORE PUBLISHED.</p>
<br>

<p>In this ballad the reader will find traces of a singular superstition,
not yet altogether discredited in the wilder parts of Scotland. The
lykewake, or watching a dead body, in itself a melancholy office, is
rendered, in the idea of the assistants, more dismally awful, by the
mysterious horrors of superstition. In the interval betwixt death and
interment, the disembodied spirit is supposed to hover around its mortal
habitation, and, if invoked by certain rites, retains the power of
communicating, through its organs, the cause of its dissolution. Such
enquiries, however are always dangerous, and never to be resorted to
unless the deceased is suspected to have suffered <i>foul play</i>, as it
is called. It is the more unsafe to tamper with this charm, in an
unauthorized manner; because the inhabitants of the infernal regions
are, at such periods, peculiarly active. One of the most potent
ceremonies in the charm, for causing the dead body to speak, is, setting
the door ajar, or half open. On this account, the peasants of Scotland
sedulously avoid leaving the door ajar, while a corpse lies in the
house. The door must either be left wide open, or quite shut; but the
first is always preferred, on account of the exercise of hospitality
usual on such occasions. The attendants must be likewise careful never
to leave the corpse for a moment alone, or, if it is left alone, to
avoid, with a degree of superstitious horror, the first sight of it.
The following story, which is frequently related by the peasants of
Scotland, will illustrate the imaginary danger of leaving the door ajar.
In former times, a man and his wife lived in a solitary cottage, on one
of the extensive border fells. One day, the husband died suddenly; and
his wife, who was equally afraid of staying alone by the corpse, or
leaving the dead body by itself, repeatedly went to the door, and
looked anxiously over the lonely moor, for the sight of some person
approaching. In her confusion and alarm, she accidentally left the door
ajar, when the corpse suddenly started up, and sat in the bed, frowning
and grinning at her frightfully. She sat alone, crying bitterly, unable
to avoid the fascination of the dead man's eye, and too much terrified
to break the sullen silence, till a catholic priest, passing over the
wild, entered the cottage. He first set the door quite open, then put
his little finger in his mouth, and said the paternoster backwards; when
the horrid look of the corpse relaxed, it fell back on the bed, and
behaved itself as a dead man ought to do.</p>

<p>YOUNG BENJIE.</p>


<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of a' the maids o' fair Scotland,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The fairest was Marjorie;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And young Benjie was her ae true love,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And a dear true love was he.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And wow! but they were lovers dear,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he's ga'en by the wan moon-light,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To meet his Marjorie.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then Marjorie turned her round about,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The tear blinding her ee,&mdash;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I darena, darena, let thee in,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;But I'll come down to thee.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then saft she smiled, and said to him,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;O what ill hae I done?&quot;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He took her in his armis twa,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And threw her o'er the linn.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The stream was strang, the maid was stout,</span><br>

<p>LADY ANNE.</p>
<br>

<p>This ballad was communicated to me by Mr Kirkpatrick Sharpe of Hoddom,
who mentions having copied it from an old magazine. Although it has
probably received some modern corrections, the general turn seems to
be ancient, and corresponds with that of a fragment, containing the
following verses, which I have often heard sung in my childhood:&mdash;</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She set her back against a thorn,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there she has her young son borne;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;O smile nae sae, my bonny babe!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;An ye smile sae sweet, ye'll smile me dead.&quot;</span><br>

<hr style="width: 45%;"><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' when that lady went to the church,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She spied a naked boy in the porch,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;O bonnie boy, an' ye were mine,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I'd clead ye in the silks sae fine.&quot;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;O mither dear, when I was thine,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;To me ye were na half sae kind.&quot;</span><br>

<p>Stories of this nature are very common in the annals of popular
superstition. It is, for example, currently believed in Ettrick Forest,
that a libertine, who had destroyed fifty-six inhabited houses, in order
to throw the possessions of the cottagers into his estate, and who added
to this injury, that of seducing their daughters, was wont to commit, to
a carrier in the neighbourhood, the care of his illegitimate children,
shortly after they were born. His emissary regularly carried them away,
but they were never again heard of. The unjust and cruel gains of the
profligate laird were dissipated by his extravagance, and the ruins of
his house seem to bear witness to the truth of the rhythmical prophecies
denounced against it, and still current among the peasantry. He himself
died an untimely death; but the agent of his amours and crimes survived
to extreme old age. When on his death-bed, he seemed much oppressed in
mind, and sent for a clergyman to speak peace to his departing spirit:
but, before the messenger returned, the man was in his last agony;
and the terrified assistants had fled from his cottage, unanimously
averring, that the wailing of murdered infants had ascended from behind
his couch, and mingled with the groans of the departing sinner.</p>

<br>

<p>LADY ANNE</p>


<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fair lady Anne sate in her bower,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Down by the greenwood side,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the flowers did spring, and the birds did sing,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">'Twas the pleasant May-day tide.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But fair lady Anne on sir William call'd,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">With the tear grit in her e'e,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;O though thou be fause, may heaven thee guard,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">&quot;In the wars ayont the sea!&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Out of the wood came three bonnie boys,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Upon the simmer's morn,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And they did sing, and play at the ba',</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">As naked as they were born.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;O seven lang year was I sit here,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">&quot;Amang the frost and snaw,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;A' to hae but ane o' these bonnie boys,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;A playing at the ba'.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then up and spake the eldest boy,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">&quot;Now listen, thou fair ladie!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And ponder well the read that I tell,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">&quot;Then make ye a choice of the three.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;'Tis I am Peter, and this is Paul,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">&quot;And that are, sae fair to see,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But a twelve-month sinsyne to paradise came,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">&quot;To join with our companie.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;O I will hae the snaw-white boy,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">&quot;The bonniest of the three.&quot;</span><br>

<p>LORD WILLIAM</p>
<br>

<p>This ballad was communicated to me by Mr James Hogg; and, although it
bears a strong resemblance to that of <i>Earl Richard</i>, so strong, indeed,
as to warrant a supposition, that the one has been derived from the
other, yet its intrinsic merit seems to warrant its insertion. Mr Hogg
has added the following note, which, in the course of my enquiries, I
have found most fully corroborated.</p>

<p>&quot;I am fully convinced of the antiquity of this song; for, although much
of the language seems somewhat modernized, this must be attributed
to its currency, being much liked, and very much sung, in this
neighbourhood. I can trace it back several generations, but cannot
hear of its ever having been in print. I have never heard it with any
considerable variation, save that one reciter called the dwelling of the
feigned sweetheart, <i>Castleswa</i>.&quot;</p>

<br>

<p>LORD WILLIAM</p>


<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lord William was the bravest knight</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, though renowned in France and Spain,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Fell by a ladie's hand.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As she was walking maid alone,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Come to my arms, my dear Willie,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">&quot;You're welcome hame to me;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;A fairer maid than ten o' you,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">&quot;I'll meet at Castle-law.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;A fairer maid than me, Willie!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">&quot;A fairer maid than me!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;A fairer maid than ten o' me,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">&quot;Your eyes did never see.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He louted owr his saddle lap,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">To kiss her ere they part,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And wi' a little keen bodkin,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">She pierced him to the heart.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Ride on, ride on, lord William, now,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">&quot;As fast as ye can dree!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Your bonny lass at Castle-law</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">&quot;Will weary you to see.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Out up then spake a bonny bird,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Sat high upon a tree,&mdash;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How could you kill that noble lord?</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">&quot;He came to marry thee.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Come down, come down, my bonny bird,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">&quot;And eat bread aff my hand!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Your cage shall be of wiry goud,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">&quot;And I will keep my tree;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She set her foot on her door step,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">A bonny marble stane;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And carried him to her chamber,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">O'er him to make her mane.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Until that word began to spread,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Then she began to fear.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then she cried on her waiting maid,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Ay ready at her ca';</span><br>

<p>The concluding verses of this ballad were inserted in the copy of
<i>Tamlane</i>, given to the public in the first edition of this work. They
are now restored to their proper place. Considering how very apt the
most accurate reciters are to patch up one ballad with verses from
another, the utmost caution cannot always avoid such errors.</p>

<p>A more sanguine antiquary than the editor might perhaps endeavour to
identify this poem, which is of undoubted antiquity, with the <i>&quot;Broom
Broom on Hill,&quot;</i> mentioned by Lane, in his <i>Progress of Queen Elizabeth
into Warwickshire</i>, as forming part of Captain's Cox's collection,
so much envied by the black-letter antiquaries of the present
day.&mdash;<i>Dugdale's Warwickshire,</i> p. 166. The same ballad is quoted by one
of the personages, in a &quot;very mery and pythie comedie,&quot; called <i>&quot;The
longer thou livest, the more fool thou art.&quot;</i> See Ritson's Dissertation,
prefixed to <i>Ancient Songs,</i> p. lx. &quot;Brume brume on hill,&quot; is also
mentioned in the <i>Complayat of Scotland</i>. See Leyden's edition, p. 100.</p>

<p>THE BROOMFIELD HILL.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There was a knight and a lady bright,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Had a true tryste at the broom;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The ane ga'ed early in the morning,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The other in the afternoon.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And ay she sat in her mother's bower door,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And ay she made her mane,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Oh whether should I gang to the Broomfield hill,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Or should I stay at hame?</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;For if I gang to the Broomfield hill,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;My maidenhead is gone;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And if I chance to stay at hame,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;My love will ca' me mansworn.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Up then spake a witch woman,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Ay from the room aboon;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;O, ye may gang to the Broomfield hill,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And yet come maiden hame.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;For, when ye gang to the Broomfield hill,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Ye'll find your love asleep,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;With a silver-belt about his head,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And a broom-cow at his feet.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Take ye the blossom of the broom,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;The blossom it smells sweet,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And strew it at your true love's head,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And likewise at his feet.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Take ye the rings off your fingers,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Put them on his right hand,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;To let him know, when he doth awake,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;His love was at his command.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She pu'd the broom flower on Hive-hill,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And strew'd on's white hals bane,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And that was to be wittering true,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">That maiden she had gane.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;O where were ye, my milk-white steed,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;That wadna watch and waken me,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I stamped wi' my foot, master,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And gar'd my bridle ring;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But na kin' thing wald waken ye,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Till she was past and gane.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And wae betide ye, my gay goss hawk,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;That I did love sae dear,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Or a' the birds, of gude green wood,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Of your flesh shall have their fill.&quot;</span><br>

<p>PROUD LADY MARGARET.</p>
<br>

<p><i>This Ballad was communicated to the Editor by Mr.</i> HAMILTON,
<i>Music-seller, Edinburgh, with whose Mother it had been a, favourite.
Two verses and one line were wanting, which are here supplied from a
different Ballad, having a plot somewhat similar. These verses are the
6th and 9th.</i></p>


<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Twas on a night, an evening bright,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When the dew began to fa',</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lady Margaret was walking up and down,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Looking o'er her castle wa'.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She looked east, and she looked west,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To see what she could spy,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When a gallant knight came in her sight,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And to the gate drew nigh.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;You seem to be no gentleman,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;You wear your boots so wide;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But you seem to be some cunning hunter,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I am no cunning hunter,&quot; he said,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Nor ne'er intend to be;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But I am come to this castle</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;To seek the love of thee;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And if you do not grant me love,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;This night for thee I'll die.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;If you should die for me, sir knight,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;There's few for you will mane,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;For mony a better has died for me,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Whose graves are growing green.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And but ye read them right,&quot; she said,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Gae stretch ye out and die.&mdash;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Now, what is the flower, the ae first flower,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Springs either on moor or dale?</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And what is the bird, the bonnie bonnie bird,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Sings on the evening gale?&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;The primrose is the ae first flower,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Sings on the evening gale.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But what's the little coin,&quot; she said,</span><br>

<p>THE ORIGINAL BALLAD OF THE BROOM OF COWDENKNOWS.</p>
<br>

<p><i>The beautiful air of Cowdenknows is well known and popular. In Ettrick
Forest the following words are uniformly adapted to the tune, and seem
to be the original ballad. An edition of this pastoral tale, differing
considerably from the present copy, was published by Mr.</i> HERD, <i>in 1772.
Cowdenknows is situated upon the river Leader, about four miles from
Melrose, and is now the property of Dr</i> HUME.</p>


<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O the broom, and the bonny bonny broom,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And the broom of the Cowdenknows!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And aye sae sweet as the lassie sang,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">I' the bought, milking the ewes.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The hills were high on ilka side,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">An' the bought i' the lirk o' the hill,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And aye, as she sang, her voice it rang</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Out o'er the head o' yon hill.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There was a troop o' gentlemen</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Came riding merrilie by,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And one of them has rode out o' the way,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To the bought to the bonny may.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Weel may ye save an' see, bonny lass,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;An' weel may ye save an' see.&quot;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;An' sae wi' you, ye weel-bred knight,&quot;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And what's your will wi' me?&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;The night is misty and mirk, fair may,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And I have ridden astray,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And will ye be so kind, fair may,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;As come out and point my way?&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Ride out, ride out, ye ramp rider!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Your steed's baith stout and strang;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;For out of the bought I dare na come,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;For fear 'at ye do me wrang.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;O winna ye pity me, bonny lass,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;O winna ye pity me?</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;An' winna ye pity my poor steed,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Stands trembling at yon tree?&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I wadna pity your poor steed,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Tho' it were tied to a thorn;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;For if ye wad gain my love the night,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Ye wad slight me ere the morn.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;For I ken you by your weel-busked hat,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And your merrie twinkling e'e,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;An' ye may weel seem for to be.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But I am not the laird o' the Oakland hills,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He's ta'en her by the middle jimp,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And by the grass-green sleeve;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He's lifted her over the fauld dyke,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And speer'd at her sma' leave.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O he's ta'en out a purse o' gowd,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And streek'd her yellow hair,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Now, take ye that, my bonnie may,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Of me till you hear mair.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O he's leapt on his berry-brown steed,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">An' soon he's o'erta'en his men;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And ane and a' cried out to him,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Ye hae na been your lane.&quot;</span><br>

<p>LORD RANDAL.</p>
<br>

<p>There is a beautiful air to this old ballad. The hero is more generally
termed <i>Lord Ronald;</i> but I willingly follow the authority of an Ettrick
Forest copy for calling him <i>Randal;</i> because, though the circumstances
are so very different, I think it not impossible, that the ballad may
have originally regarded the death of Thomas Randolph, or Randal, earl
of Murray, nephew to Robert Bruce, and governor of Scotland. This great
warrior died at Musselburgh, 1332, at the moment when his services were
most necessary to his country, already threatened by an English army.
For this sole reason, perhaps, our historians obstinately impute his
death to poison. See <i>The Bruce</i>, book xx. Fordun repeats, and Boece
echoes, this story, both of whom charge the murder on Edward III. But it
is combated successfully by Lord Hailes, in his <i>Remarks on the History
of Scotland</i>.</p>

<p>The substitution of some venomous reptile for food, or putting it into
liquor, was anciently supposed to be a common mode of administering
poison; as appears from the following curious account of the death of
King John, extracted from a MS. Chronicle of England, <i>penes</i> John
Clerk, esq. advocate. &quot;And, in the same tyme, the pope sente into
Englond a legate, that men cald Swals, and he was prest cardinal of
Rome, for to mayntene King Johnes cause agens the barons of Englond; but
the barons had so much pte (<i>poustie</i>, i.e. power) through Lewys, the
kinges sone of Fraunce, that King Johne wist not wher for to wend ne
gone: and so hitt fell, that he wold have gone to Suchold; and as he
went thedurward, he come by the abbey of Swinshed, and ther he abode II
dayes. And, as he sate at meat, he askyd a monke of the house, how moche
a lofe was worth, that was before hym sete at the table? and the monke
sayd that loffe was worthe bot ane halfpenny. 'O!' quod the kyng, 'this
is a grette cheppe of brede; now,' said the king, 'and yff I may, such a
loffe shalle be worth xxd. or half a yer be gone:' and when he said the
word, muche he thought, and ofte tymes sighed, and nome and ete of the
bred, and said, 'By Gode, the word that I have spokyn shall be sothe.'
The monke, that stode befor the kyng, was ful sory in his hert; and
thought rather he wold himself suffer peteous deth; and thought yff
he myght ordeyn therfore sum remedy. And anon the monke went unto his
abbott, and was schryvyd of him, and told the abbott all that the kyng
said, and prayed his abbott to assoyl him, for he wold gyffe the kyng
such a wassayle, that all Englond shuld be glad and joyful therof. Tho
went the monke into a gardene, and fond a tode therin; and toke her upp,
and put hyr in a cuppe, and filled it with good ale, and pryked hyr in
every place, in the cuppe, till the venome come out in every place; an
brought hitt befor the kyng, and knelyd, and said, 'Sir, wassayle; for
never in your lyfe drancke ye of such a cuppe,' 'Begyne, monke,' quod
the king; and the monke dranke a gret draute, and toke the kyng the
cuppe, and the kyng also drank a grett draute, and set downe the
cuppe.&mdash;The monke anon went to the Farmarye, and ther dyed anon, on
whose soule God have mercy, Amen. And v monkes syng for his soule
especially, and shall while the abbey stondith. The kyng was anon ful
evil at ese, and comaunded to remove the table, and askyd after the
monke; and men told him that he was ded, for his wombe was broke in
sondur. When the king herd this tidyng, he comaunded for to trusse; but
all hit was for nought, for his bely began to swelle for the drink that
he dranke, that he dyed within II dayes, the moro aftur Seynt Luke's
day.&quot;</p>

<p>A different account of the poisoning of King John is given in a MS.
Chronicle of England, written in the minority of Edward III., and
contained in the Auchinleck MS. of Edinburgh. Though not exactly to our
present purpose, the passage is curious, and I shall quote it without
apology. The author has mentioned the interdict laid on John's kingdom
by the pope, and continues thus:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He was ful wroth and grim,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For no prest wald sing for him</span><br>

<p>Shakespeare, from such old chronicles, has drawn his authority for the
last fine scene in <i>King John</i>. But he probably had it from Caxton, who
uses nearly the words of the prose chronicle. Hemingford tells the same
tale with the metrical historian. It is certain, that John increased the
flux, of which he died, by the intemperate use of peaches and of ale,
which may have given rise to the story of the poison.&mdash;See MATTHEW
PARIS.</p>

<p>To return to the ballad: there is a very similar song, in which,
apparently to excite greater interest in the nursery, the handsome young
hunter is exchanged for a little child, poisoned by a false step-mother.</p>

<br>

<p>SIR HUGH LE BLOND.</p>
<br>

<p>This ballad is a northern composition, and seems to have been the
original of the legend called <i>Sir Aldingar</i>, which is printed in the
<i>Reliques of Antient Poetry</i>. The incidents are nearly the same in both
ballads, excepting that, in <i>Aldingar</i>, an angel combats for the queen,
instead of a mortal champion. The names of <i>Aldingar</i> and <i>Rodingham</i>
approach near to each other in sound, though not in orthography, and the
one might, by reciters, be easily substituted for the other.</p>

<p>The tradition, upon which the ballad is founded, is universally current
in the Mearns; and the editor is informed, that, till very lately, the
sword, with which Sir Hugh le Blond was believed to have defended
the life and honour of the queen, was carefully preserved by his
descendants, the viscounts of Arbuthnot. That Sir Hugh of Arbuthnot
lived in the thirteenth century, is proved by his having, in 1282,
bestowed the patronage of the church of Garvoch upon the monks of
Aberbrothwick, for the safety of his soul.&mdash;<i>Register of Aberbrothwick,
quoted by Crawford in Peerage.</i> But I find no instance in history, in
which the honour of a queen of Scotland was committed to the chance of
a duel. It is true, that Mary, wife of Alexander II., was, about 1242,
somewhat implicated in a dark story, concerning the murder of Patrick,
earl of Athole, burned in his lodging at Haddington, where he had gone
to attend a great tournament. The relations of the deceased baron
accused of the murder Sir William Bisat, a powerful nobleman, who
appears to have been in such high favour with the young queen, that
she offered her oath, as a compurgator, to prove his innocence. Bisat
himself stood upon his defence, and proffered the combat to his
accusers; but he was obliged to give way to the tide, and was banished
from Scotland. This affair interested all the northern barons; and it
is not impossible, that some share, taken in it by this Sir Hugh de
Arbuthnot, may have given a slight foundation for the tradition of the
country.&mdash;WINTON, B. vii. ch. 9. Or, if we suppose Sir Hugh le Blond
to be a predecessor of the Sir Hugh who flourished in the thirteenth
century, he may have been the victor in a duel, shortly noticed as
having occurred in 1154, when one Arthur, accused of treason, was
unsuccessful in his appeal to the judgment of God. <i>Arthurus regem
Malcolm proditurus duello periit.</i> Chron. Sanctae Crucis ap. Anglia
Sacra, Vol. I. p. 161.</p>

<p>But, true or false, the incident, narrated in the ballad, is in the
genuine style of chivalry. Romances abound with similar instances, nor
are they wanting in real history. The most solemn part of a knight's
oath was to defend &quot;all widows, orphelines, and maidens of gude
fame.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_A_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_88"><sup>[A]</sup></a>&mdash;LINDSAY'S <i>Heraldry, MS.</i> The love of arms was a real
passion of itself, which blazed yet more fiercely when united with the
enthusiastic admiration of the fair sex. The knight of Chaucer exclaims,
with chivalrous energy,</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To fight for a lady! a benedicite!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It were a lusty sight for to see.</span><br>

<p>It was an argument, seriously urged by Sir John of Heinault, for making
war upon Edward II., in behalf of his banished wife, Isabella, that
knights were bound to aid, to their uttermost power, all distressed
damsels, living without council or comfort.</p>

<a name="Footnote_A_88"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_88">[A]</a><div class="note"><p> Such an oath is still taken by the Knights of the Bath;
but, I believe, few of that honourable brotherhood will now consider it
quite so obligatory as the conscientious Lord Herbert of Cherbury, who
gravely alleges it as a sufficient reason for having challenged divers
cavaliers, that they had either snatched from a lady her bouquet, or
ribband, or, by some discourtesy of similar importance, placed her, as
his lordship conceived, in the predicament of a distressed damozell.</p></div>

<p>An apt illustration of the ballad would have been the combat, undertaken
by three Spanish champions against three Moors of Granada, in defence of
the honour of the queen of Granada, wife to Mohammed Chiquito, the last
monarch of that kingdom. But I have not at hand <i>Las Guerras Civiles
de Granada</i>, in which that atchievement is recorded. Raymond Berenger,
count of Barcelona, is also said to have defended, in single combat, the
life and honour of the Empress Matilda, wife of the Emperor Henry V.,
and mother to Henry II. of England.&mdash;See ANTONIO ULLOA, <i>del vero Honore
Militare</i>, Venice, 1569.</p>

<p>A less apocryphal example is the duel, fought in 1387, betwixt Jaques le
Grys and John de Carogne, before the king of France. These warriors were
retainers of the earl of Alencon, and originally sworn brothers. John de
Carogne went over the sea, for the advancement of his fame, leaving in
his castle a beautiful wife, where she lived soberly and sagely. But
the devil entered into the heart of Jaques le Grys, and he rode, one
morning, from the earl's house to the castle of his friend, where he was
hospitably received by the unsuspicious lady. He requested her to
show him the donjon, or keep of the castle, and in that remote and
inaccessible tower forcibly violated her chastity. He then mounted his
horse, and returned to the earl of Alencon within so short a space, that
his absence had not been perceived. The lady abode within the donjon,
weeping bitterly, and exclaiming, &quot;Ah Jaques! it was not well done thus
to shame me! but on you shall the shame rest, if God send my husband
safe home!&quot; The lady kept secret this sorrowful deed until her husband's
return from his voyage. The day passed, and night came, and the knight
went to bed; but the lady would not; for ever she blessed herself,
and walked up and down the chamber, studying and musing, until her
attendants had retired; and then, throwing herself on her knees before
the knight, she shewed him all the adventure. Hardly would Carogne
believe the treachery of his companion; but, when convinced, he replied,
&quot;Since it is so, lady, I pardon you; but the knight shall die for this
villainous deed.&quot; Accordingly, Jaques le Grys was accused of the crime,
in the court of the earl of Alencon. But, as he was greatly loved of
his lord, and as the evidence was very slender, the earl gave judgment
against the accusers. Hereupon John Carogne appealed to the parliament
of Paris; which court, after full consideration, appointed the case to
be tried by mortal combat betwixt the parties, John Carogne appearing as
the champion of his lady. If he failed in his combat, then was he to
be hanged, and his lady burned, as false and unjust calumniators. This
combat, under circumstances so very peculiar, attracted universal
attention; in so much, that the king of France and his peers, who were
then in Flanders, collecting troops for an invasion of England, returned
to Paris, that so notable a duel might be fought in the royal presence.
&quot;Thus the kynge, and his uncles, and the constable, came to Parys. Then
the lystes were made in a place called Saynt Katheryne, behinde the
Temple. There was soo moche people, that it was mervayle to beholde; and
on the one side of the lystes there was made gret scaffoldes, that the
lordes might the better se the batayle of the ii champion; and so they
bothe came to the felde, armed at all peaces, and there eche of them was
set in theyr chayre; the erle of Saynt Poule gouverned John of Carongne,
and the erle of Alanson's company with Jacques le Grys; and when the
knyght entred in to the felde, he came to his wyfe, who was there
syttynge in a chayre, covered in blacke, and he sayd to her thus:&mdash;Dame,
by your enformacyon, and in your quarrell, I do put my lyfe in
adventure, as to fyght with Jacques le Grys; ye knowe, if the cause be
just and true.'&mdash;'Syr,' sayd the lady, 'it is as I have sayd; wherefore
ye maye fyght surely; the cause is good and true.' With those wordes,
the knyghte kissed the lady, and toke her by the hande, and then blessyd
hym, and soo entred into the felde. The lady sate styll in the blacke
chayre, in her prayers to God, and to the vyrgyne Mary, humbly prayenge
them, by theyr specyall grace, to send her husbande the victory,
accordynge to the ryght. She was in gret hevynes, for she was not sure
of her lyfe; for, if her husbande sholde have ben dyscomfyted, she was
judged, without remedy, to be brente, and her husbande hanged. I cannot
say whether she repented her or not, as the matter was so forwarde, that
both she and her husbande were in grete peryll: howbeit, fynally, she
must as then abyde the adventure. Then these two champyons were set
one agaynst another, and so mounted on theyr horses, and behauved them
nobly; for they knewe what perteyned to deades of armes. There were
many lordes and knyghtes of Fraunce, that were come thyder to se that
batayle. The two champyons justed at theyr fyrst metyng, but none of
them dyd hurte other; and, after the justes, they lyghted on foote to
periournie theyr batayle, and soo fought valyauntly.&mdash;And fyrst, John of
Carongne was hurt in the thyghe, whereby al his frendes were in grete
fere; but, after that, he fought so valyauntly, that he bette down his
adversary to the erthe, and threst his swerde in his body, and soo slewe
hyrn in the felde; and then he demaunded, if he had done his devoyse or
not? and they answered, that he had valyauntly atchieved his batayle.
Then Jacques le Grys was delyuered to the hangman of Parys, and he drewe
hym to the gybbet of Mountfawcon, and there hanged him up. Then John of
Carongne came before the kynge, and kneled downe, and the kynge made
him to stand up before hym; and, the same daye, the kynge caused to
be delyvred to him a thousande franks, and reteyned him to be of his
chambre, with a pencyon of ii hundred pounde by yere, durynge the terme
of his lyfe. Then he thanked the kynge and the lordes, and went to his
wyfe, and kissed her; and then they wente togyder to the chyrche of our
ladye, in Parys, and made theyr offerynge, and then retourned to their
lodgynges. Then this Sir John of Carongne taryed not longe in Fraunce,
but went, with Syr John Boucequant, Syr John of Bordes, and Syr Loys
Grat. All these went to se Lamorabaquyn,<a name="FNanchor_A_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_89"><sup>[A]</sup></a> of whome, in those dayes,
there was moche spekynge.&quot;</p>

<p>Such was the readiness, with which, in those times, heroes put their
lives in jeopardy, for honour and lady's sake. But I doubt whether the
fair dames of the present day will think, that the risk of being burned,
upon every suspicion of frailty, could be altogether compensated by the
probability, that a husband of good faith, like John de Carogne, or a
disinterested champion, like Hugh le Blond, would take up the gauntlet
in their behalf. I fear they will rather accord to the sentiment of the
hero of an old romance, who expostulates thus with a certain duke:&mdash;</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Certes, sir duke, thou doest unright,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To make a roast of your daughter bright;</span><br>

<p>I was favoured with the following copy of <i>Sir Hugh le Blond</i>, by
K. Williamson Burnet, Esq. of Monboddo, who wrote it down from the
recitation of an old woman, long in the service of the Arbuthnot
family. Of course the diction is very much humbled, and it has, in
all probability, undergone many corruptions; but its antiquity is
indubitable, and the story, though indifferently told, is in itself
interesting. It is believed, that there have been many more verses.</p>

<br>

<p>SIR HUGH LE BLOND.</p>


<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The birds sang sweet as ony bell,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The world had not their make,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The queen she's gone to her chamber,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">With Rodingham to talk.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I love you well, my queen, my dame,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;'Bove land and rents so clear</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And for the love of you, my queen,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Would thole pain most severe.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;If well you love me, Rodingham,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;I'm sure so do I thee:</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I love you well as any man,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Save the king's fair bodye.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I love you well, my queen, my dame;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;'Tis truth that I do tell:</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And for to lye a night with you,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;The salt seas I would sail.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Away, away, O Rodingham!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;You are both stark and stoor;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Would you defile the king's own bed,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And make his queen a whore?</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;To-morrow you'd be taken sure,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And like a traitor slain;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And I'd be burned at a stake,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Altho' I be the queen.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He then stepp'd out at her room-door,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">All in an angry mood;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Until he met a leper-man,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Just by the hard way-side.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He intoxicate the leper-man</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">With liquors very sweet;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And gave him more and more to drink,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Until he fell asleep.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He took him in his arms two,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And carried him along,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till he came to the queen's own bed,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And there he laid him down.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He then stepp'd out of the queen's bower,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">As switt as any roe,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till he came to the very place</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Where the king himself did go.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The king said unto Rodingham,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;What news have you to me?&quot;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He said, &quot;Your queen's a false woman,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;As I did plainly see.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He hasten'd to the queen's chamber,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">So costly and so fine,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Untill he came to the queen's own bed,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Where the leper-man was lain.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He looked on the leper-man,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Who lay on his queen's bed;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He lifted up the snaw-white sheets,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And thus he to him said:</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Plooky, plooky,<a name="FNanchor_A_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_90"><sup>[A]</sup></a> are your cheeks,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And plooky is your chin,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And plooky are your arms two</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;My bonny queen's layne in.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Since she has lain into your arms,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;She shall not lye in mine;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Since she has kiss'd your ugsome mouth,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;She never shall kiss mine.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In anger he went to the queen,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Who fell upon her knee;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He said, &quot;You false, unchaste woman,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;What's this you've done to me?&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The queen then turn'd herself about,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The tear blinded her e'e&mdash;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There's not a knight in all your court</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Dare give that name to me.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He said, &quot;'Tis true that I do say;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;For I a proof did make:</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;You shall be taken from my bower,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And burned at a stake.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Perhaps I'll take my word again,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And may repent the same,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;If that you'll get a Christian man</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;To fight that Rodingham.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Alas! alas!&quot; then cried our queen,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Alas, and woe to me!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;There's not a man in all Scotland</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Will fight with him for me.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She breathed unto her messengers,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Sent them south, east, and west;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They could find none to fight with him,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Nor enter the contest.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She breathed on her messengers,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">She sent them to the north;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there they found Sir Hugh le Blond,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To fight him he came forth.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When unto him they did unfold</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The circumstance all right,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He bade them go and tell the queen,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">That for her he would fight.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The day came on that was to do</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">That dreadful tragedy;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sir Hugh le Blond was not come up</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To fight for our lady.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Put on the fire,&quot; the monster said;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;It is twelve on the bell!&quot;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Tis scarcely ten, now,&quot; said the king;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;I heard the clock mysell.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Before the hour the queen is brought,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The burning to proceed;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a black velvet chair she's set,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">A token for the dead.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She saw the flames ascending high,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The tears blinded her e'e:</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Where is the worthy knight,&quot; she said,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Who is to fight for me?&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then up and spake the king himsel,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;My dearest, have no doubt,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;For yonder comes the man himsel,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;As bold as ere set out.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They then advanced to fight the duel</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">With swords of temper'd steel,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till down the blood of Rodingham</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Came running to his heel.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sir Hugh took out a lusty sword,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">'Twas of the metal clear;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he has pierced Rodingham</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Till's heart-blood did appear.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Confess your treachery, now,&quot; he said,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;This day before you die!&quot;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I do confess my treachery,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;I shall no longer lye:</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I like to wicked Haman am,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;This day I shall be slain.&quot;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The queen was brought to her chamber</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">A good woman again.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The queen then said unto the king,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Arbattle's near the sea;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Give it unto the northern knight,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;That this day fought for me.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then said the king, &quot;Come here, sir knight,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And drink a glass of wine;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And, if Arbattle's not enough,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;To it we'll Fordoun join.&quot;</span><br>

<p>NOTES ON SIR HUGH LE BLOND.</p>


<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Until he met a leper-man. &amp;c.</i>&mdash;P. 268. v. 4.</span><br>

<p>Filth, poorness of living, and the want of linen, made this horrible
disease formerly very common in Scotland. Robert Bruce died of the
leprosy; and, through all Scotland, there were hospitals erected for
the reception of lepers, to prevent their mingling with the rest of the
community.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>&quot;It is twelve on the bell!&quot;</i></span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>&quot;Tis scarcely ten, now,&quot; said the king, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;P. 272. v. 2.</span><br>

<p>In the romance of Doolin, called <i>La Fleur des Battailles</i>, a false
accuser discovers a similar impatience to hurry over the execution,
before the arrival of the lady's champion:&mdash;<i>&quot;Ainsi comme Herchambaut
vouloit jetter la dame dedans le feu, Sanxes de Clervaut va a lui, si
lui dict; 'Sire Herchambaut, vous estes trop a blasmer; car vous ne
devez mener ceste chose que par droit ainsi qu'il est ordonn&egrave;; je veux
accorder que ceste dame ait un vassal qui la diffendra contre vous et
Drouart, car elle n'a point de coulpe en ce que l'accusez; si la devez
retarder jusque a midy, pour scavoir si un bon chevalier l'a viendra
secourir centre vous et Drouart.&quot;</i>&mdash;Cap. 22.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>&quot;And, if Arbattle's not enough,</i></span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>&quot;To it we'll Fordoun join.&quot;</i>&mdash;P. 274. v. 1.</span><br>

<p>Arbattle is the ancient name of the barony of Arbuthnot. Fordun has long
been the patrimony of the same family.</p>

<br>

<p>GRAEME AND BEWICK.</p>
<br>

<p>The date of this ballad, and its subject, are uncertain. From internal
evidence, I am inclined to place it late in the sixteenth century. Of
the Graemes enough is elsewhere said. It is not impossible, that such
a clan, as they are described, may have retained the rude ignorance
of ancient border manners to a later period than their more inland
neighbours; and hence the taunt of old Bewick to Graeme. Bewick is an
ancient name in Cumberland and Northumberland. The ballad itself was
given, in the first edition, from the recitation of a gentleman, who
professed to have forgotten some verses. These have, in the present
edition, been partly restored, from a copy obtained by the recitation of
an ostler in Carlisle, which has also furnished some slight alterations.</p>

<p>The ballad is remarkable, as containing, probably, the very latest
allusion to the institution of brotherhood in arms, which was held so
sacred in the days of chivalry, and whose origin may be traced up to the
Scythian ancestors of Odin. Many of the old romances turn entirely upon
the sanctity of the engagement, contracted by the <i>freres d'armes</i>. In
that of <i>Amis and Amelion</i>, the hero slays his two infant children, that
he may compound a potent salve with their blood, to cure the leprosy of
his brother in arms. The romance of <i>Gyron le Courtois</i> has a similar
subject. I think the hero, like Graeme in the ballad, kills himself, out
of some high point of honour towards his friend.</p>

<p>The quarrel of the two old chieftains, over their wine, is highly in
character. Two generations have not elapsed since the custom of drinking
deep, and taking deadly revenge for slight offences, produced very
tragical events on the border; to which the custom of going armed to
festive meetings contributed not a little. A minstrel, who flourished
about 1720, and is often talked of by the old people, happened to be
performing before one of these parties, when they betook themselves to
their swords. The cautious musician, accustomed to such scenes, dived
beneath the table. A moment after, a man's hand, struck off with a
back-sword, fell beside him. The minstrel secured it carefully in
his pocket, as he would have done any other loose moveable; sagely
observing, the owner would miss it sorely next morning. I chuse rather
to give this ludicrous example, than some graver instances of bloodshed
at border orgies. I observe it is said, in a MS. account of Tweeddale,
in praise of the inhabitants, that, &quot;when they fall in the humour of
good fellowship, they use it as a cement and bond of society, and not
to foment revenge, quarrels, and murders, which is usual in other
countries;&quot; by which we ought, probably, to understand Selkirkshire and
Teviotdale.&mdash;<i>Macfarlane's MSS.</i></p>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;The wind has blown it from your hand.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;What's that thou says, thou limmer loun?</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;How dares thou stand to speak to me?</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;If thou do not end this quarrel soon,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;There's my right hand thou shalt fight with me.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then Christie Graeme's to his chamber gane,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To consider weel what then should be;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whether he suld fight with his auld father</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Or with his billie Bewick, he.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;If I suld kill my billie dear,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;God's blessing I sall never win;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But if I strike at my auld father,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;I think 'twald be a mortal sin.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But if I kill my billie dear,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;It is God's will! so let it be.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But I make a vow, ere I gang frae hame,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;That I shall be the next man's die.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then he's put on's back a good ould jack,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And on his head a cap of steel,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sword and buckler by his side;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">O gin he did not become them weel!</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We'll leave off talking of Christie Graeme,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And talk of him again belive;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And we will talk of bonnie Bewick,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Where he was teaching his scholars five.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When he had taught them well to fence,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And handle swords without any doubt;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He took his sword under his arm,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And he walked his father's close about.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He looked atween him and the sun,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And a' to see what there might be,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till he spied a man, in armour bright,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Was riding that way most hastilie.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;O wha is yon, that came this way,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Sae hastilie that hither came?</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I think it be my brother dear;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;I think it be young Christie Graeme.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Ye're welcome here, my billie dear,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And thrice you're welcome unto me!&quot;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But I'm wae to say, I've seen the day,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;When I am come to fight with thee.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;My father's gane to Carlisle town,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Wi' your father Bewick there met he;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;He says I'm a lad, and I am but bad,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And a baffled man I trow I be.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;He sent me to schools, and I wadna learn;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;He gae me books, and I wadna read;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Sae my father's blessing I'll never earn,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Till he see how my arm can guard my head.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;O God forbid, my billie dear,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;That ever such a thing suld be!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;We'll take three men on either side,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And see if we can our fathers agree.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;O hald thy tongue, now, billie Bewick,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And of thy talking let me be!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But if thou'rt a man, as I'm sure thou art,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Come o'er the dyke, and fight wi' me.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But I hae nae harness, billie, on my back,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;As weel I see there is on thine.&quot;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But as little harness as is on thy back,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;As little, billie, shall be on mine.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then he's thrown aff his coat of mail,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">His cap of steel away flung he;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He stuck his spear into the ground,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And he tied his horse unto a tree.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then Bewick has thrown aff his cloak,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And's psalter-book frae's hand flung he;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He laid his hand upon the dyke,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And ower he lap most manfullie.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O they hae fought for twae lang hours;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">When twae lang hours were come and gane,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sweat drapped fast frae aff them baith,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">But a drap of blude could not be seen.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till Graeme gae Bewick an ackward<a name="FNanchor_B_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_92"><sup>[B]</sup></a> stroke,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Ane ackward stroke, strucken sickerlie;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He has hit him under the left breast,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And dead-wounded to the ground fell he.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Rise up, rise up, now, hillie dear!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Arise, and speak three words to me!&mdash;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Whether thou'se gotten thy deadly wound,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Or if God and good leaching may succour thee?&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;O horse, O horse, now billie Graeme,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;And get thee far from hence with speed;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And get thee out of this country,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;That none may know who has done the deed.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;O I have slain thee, billie Bewick,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;If this be true thou tellest to me;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But I made a vow, ere I came frae hame,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;That aye the next man I wad be.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He has pitched his sword in a moodie-hill,<a name="FNanchor_C_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_93"><sup>[C]</sup></a></span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And he has leap'd twentie lang feet and three,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And on his ain sword's point he lap,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And dead upon the grund fell he.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Twas then came up Sir Robert Bewick,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And his brave son alive saw he;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Rise up, rise up, my son,&quot; he said,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;For I think ye hae gotten the victorie.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;O hald your tongue, my father dear!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Of your prideful talking let me be!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Ye might hae drunken your wine in peace,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Alack! a wae!&quot; auld Bewick cried,</span><br>

<br>

<p>THE DUEL OF WHARTON AND STUART. IN TWO PARTS.</p>
<br>

<p>Duels, as may be seen from the two preceding ballads, are derived from
the times of chivalry. They succeeded to the <i>combat at outrance</i>,
about the end of the sixteenth century; and, though they were no longer
countenanced by the laws, nor considered a solemn appeal to the Deity,
nor honoured by the presence of applauding monarchs and multitudes, yet
they were authorised by the manners of the age, and by the applause of
the fair.<a name="FNanchor_A_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_94"><sup>[A]</sup></a> They long continued, they even yet continue, to be appealed
to, as the test of truth; since, by the code of honour, every gentleman
is still bound to repel a charge of falsehood with the point of his
sword, and at the peril of his life. This peculiarity of manners, which
would have surprised an ancient Roman, is obviously deduced from the
Gothic ordeal of trial by combat. Nevertheless, the custom of duelling
was considered, at its first introduction, as an innovation upon the law
of arms; and a book, in two huge volumes, entituled <i>Le vrai Theatre
d' Honneur et de la Chivalerie</i>, was written by a French nobleman,
to support the venerable institutions of chivalry against this
unceremonious mode of combat. He has chosen for his frontispiece two
figures; the first represents a conquering knight, trampling his enemy
under foot in the lists, crowned by Justice with laurel, and preceded by
Fame, sounding his praises. The other figure presents a duellist, in
his shirt, as was then the fashion (see the following ballad), with his
bloody rapier in his hand: the slaughtered combatant is seen in the
distance, and the victor is pursued by the Furies. Nevertheless, the
wise will make some scruple, whether, if the warriors were to change
equipments, they might not also exchange their emblematic attendants.
The modern mode of duel, without defensive armour, began about the reign
of Henry III. of France, when the gentlemen of that nation, as we learn
from Davila, began to lay aside the cumbrous lance and cuirass, even in
war. The increase of danger being supposed to contribute to the increase
of honour, the national ardour of the french gallants led them early to
distinguish themselves by neglect of every thing, that could contribute
to their personal safety. Hence, duels began to be fought by the
combatants in their shirts, and with the rapier only. To this custom
contributed also the art of fencing, then cultivated as a new study in
Italy and Spain, by which the sword became, at once, an offensive and
defensive weapon. The reader will see the new &quot;science of defence,&quot; as
it was called, ridiculed by Shakespeare, in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, and
by Don Quevedo, in some of his novels. But the more ancient customs
continued for some time to maintain their ground. The sieur Colombiere
mentions two gentlemen, who fought with equal advantage for a whole day,
in all the panoply of chivalry, and, the next day, had recourse to the
modern mode of combat. By a still more extraordinary mixture of ancient
and modern fashions, two combatants on horseback ran a tilt at each
other with lances, without any covering but their shirts.</p>

<a name="Footnote_A_94"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_94">[A]</a><div class="note"><p> &quot;All things being ready for the ball, and every one being
in their place, and I myself being next to the queen (of France),
expecting when the dancers would come in, one knockt at the door
somewhat louder than became, as I thought, a very civil person. When he
came in, I remember there was a sudden whisper among the ladies, saying,
'C'est Monsieur Balagny,' or, 'tis Monsieur Balagny; whereupon, also,
I saw the ladies and gentlewomen, one after another, invite him to sit
near them; and, which is more, when one lady had his company a while,
another would say, 'you have enjoyed him long enough; I must have him
now;' at which bold civility of theirs, though I were astonished, yet it
added unto my wonder, that his person could not be thought, at most, but
ordinary handsome; his hair, which was cut very short, half grey, his
doublet but of sackcloth, cut to his shirt, and his breeches only of
plain grey cloth. Informing myself of some standers by who he was, I was
told he was one of the gallantest men in the world, as having killed
eight or nine men in single fight; and that, for this reason, the ladies
made so much of him; it being the manner of all French women to cherish
gallant men, as thinking they could not make so much of any one else,
with the safety of their honour.&quot;&mdash;<i>Life of Lord Herbert of Cherbury,</i>
p. 70. How near the character of the duellist, originally, approached to
that of the knight-errant, appears from a transaction, which took place
at the siege of Juliers, betwixt this Balagny and Lord Herbert. As
these two noted duellists stood together in the trenches, the Frenchman
addressed Lord Herbert: <i>&quot;Monsieur, on dit que vous etes un des plus
braves de votre nation, et je suis Balagny; allons voir qui fera le
mieux.&quot;</i> With these words, Balagny jumped over the trench, and Herbert
as speedily following, both ran sword in hand towards the defences
of the besieged town, which welcomed their approach with a storm of
musquetry and artillery. Balagny then observed, this was hot service;
but Herbert swore, he would not turn back first; so the Frenchman was
finally fain to set him the example or retreat. Notwithstanding the
advantage which he had gained over Balagny, in this &quot;jeopardy of war,&quot;
Lord Herbert seems still to have grudged that gentleman's astonishing
reputation; for he endeavoured to pick a quarrel with him, on the
romantic score of the worth of their mistresses; and, receiving a
ludicrous answer, told him, with disdain, that he spoke more like a
<i>palliard</i> than a <i>cavalier</i>. From such instances the reader may judge,
whether the age of chivalry did not endure somewhat longer than is
generally supposed.</p></div>

<p>When armour was laid aside, the consequence was, that the first duels
were very sanguinary, terminating frequently in the death of one, and
sometimes, as in the ballad, of both persons engaged. Nor was this all:
The seconds, who had nothing to do with the quarrel, fought stoutly,
<i>pour se desennuyer</i>, and often sealed with their blood their friendship
for their principal. A desperate combat, fought between Messrs Entraguet
and Caylus, is said to have been the first, in which this fashion of
promiscuous fight was introduced. It proved fatal to two of Henry the
Third's minions, and extracted from that sorrowing monarch an edict
against duelling, which was as frequently as fruitlessly renewed by his
successors. The use of rapier and poniard together,<a name="FNanchor_A_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_95"><sup>[A]</sup></a> was another cause
of the mortal slaughter in these duels, which were supposed, in the
reign of Henry IV., to have cost France at least as many of her nobles
as had fallen in the civil wars. With these double weapons, frequent
instances occurred, in which a duellist, mortally wounded, threw himself
within his antagonist's guard, and plunged his poniard into his heart.
Nay, sometimes the sword was altogether abandoned for the more sure
and murderous dagger. A quarrel having arisen betwixt the vicompte d'
Allemagne and the sieur de la Roque, the former, alleging the youth and
dexterity of his antagonist, insisted upon fighting the duel in their
shirts, and with their poniards only; a desperate mode of conflict,
which proved fatal to both. Others refined even upon this horrible
struggle, by chusing for the scene a small room, a large hogshead, or,
finally, a hole dug in the earth, into which the duellists descended, as
into a certain grave.&mdash;Must I add, that even women caught the phrenzy,
and that duels were fought, not only by those whose rank and character
rendered it little surprising, but by modest and well-born maidens!

<a name="Footnote_A_95"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_95">[A]</a><div class="note"><p> It appears from a line in the black-letter copy of the

<a name="Footnote_B_96"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_96">[B]</a><div class="note"><p> This folly ran to such a pitch, that no one was thought
worthy to be reckoned a gentleman, who had not tried his valour in at
least one duel; of which Lord Herbert gives the following instance:&mdash;A
young gentleman, desiring to marry a niece of Monsieur Disaucour,
<i>ecuyer</i> to the duke de Montmorenci, received this answer: &quot;Friend, it
is not yet time to marry; if you will be a brave man, you must first
kill, in single combat, two or three men; then marry, and get two or
three children; otherwise the world will neither have gained or lost by
you.&quot; HERBERT'S <i>Life</i>, p. 64.</p></div>

<p>We learn, from every authority, that duels became nearly as common in
England, after the accession of James VI., as they had ever been in
France. The point of honour, so fatal to the gallants of the age, was no
where carried more highly than at the court of the pacific <i>Solomon</i>
of Britain. Instead of the feudal combats, upon the <i>Hie-gate of
Edinburgh</i>, which had often disturbed his repose at Holy-rood, his
levees, at Theobald's, were occupied with listening to the detail of
more polished, but not less sanguinary, contests. I rather suppose, that
James never was himself disposed to pay particular attention to the laws
of the <i>duello;</i> but they were defined with a quaintness and pedantry,
which, bating his dislike to the subject, must have deeply interested
him. The point of honour was a science, which a grown gentleman might
study under suitable professors, as well as dancing, or any other
modish accomplishment. Nay, it would appear, that the ingenuity of
the <i>sword-men</i> (so these military casuists were termed) might often
accommodate a bashful combatant with an honourable excuse for declining
the combat:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&mdash;Understand'st them well nice points of duel?</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Art born of gentle blood and pure descent?</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were none of all thy lineage hang'd, or cuckold?</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bastard or bastinadoed? Is thy pedigree</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As long, as wide as mine? For otherwise</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou wert most unworthy; and 'twere loss of honour</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In me to fight. More: I have drawn five teeth&mdash;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If thine stand sound, the terms are much unequal;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, by strict laws of duel, I am excused</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To fight on disadvantage.&mdash;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Albumazar,</i> Act IV. Sc. 7.</span><br>

<p>In Beaumont and Fletcher's admirable play of <i>A King and no King</i>, there
is some excellent mirth at the expence of the professors of the point of
honour.</p>

<p>But, though such shifts might occasionally be resorted to by the
faint-hearted, yet the fiery cavaliers of the English court were but
little apt to profit by them; though their vengeance for insulted honour
sometimes vented itself through fouler channels than that of fair combat
It happened, for example, that Lord Sanquhar, a Scottish nobleman, in
fencing with a master of the noble science of defence, lost his eye by
an unlucky thrust. The accident was provoking, but without remedy; nor
did Lord Sanquhar think of it, unless with regret, until some years
after, when he chanced to be in the French court. Henry the Great
casually asked him, how he lost his eye? &quot;By the thrust of a sword,&quot;
answered Lord Sanquhar, not caring to enter into particulars. The king,
supposing the accident the consequence of a duel, immediately enquired,
&quot;Does the man yet live?&quot; These few words set the blood of the Scottish
nobleman on fire; nor did he rest till he had taken the base vengeance
of assassinating, by hired ruffians, the unfortunate fencing-master. The
mutual animosity betwixt the English and Scottish nations, had already
occasioned much bloodshed among the gentry, by single combat; and James
now found himself under the necessity of making a striking example of
one of his Scottish nobles, to avoid the imputation of the grossest
partiality. Lord Sanquhar was condemned to be hanged, and suffered that
ignominious punishment accordingly.</p>

<p>By a circuitous route, we are now arrived at the subject of our ballad;
for, to the tragical duel of Stuart and Wharton, and to other instances
of bloody combats and brawls betwixt the two nations, is imputed James's
firmness in the case of Lord Sanquhar.</p>

<p>&quot;For Ramsay, one of the king's servants, not long before Sanquhar's
trial, had switched the earl of Montgomery, who was the king's first
favourite, happily because he tooke it so. Maxwell, another of them, had
bitten Hawley, a gentleman of the Temple, by the ear, which enraged the
Templars (in those times riotous, and subject to tumults), and brought
it allmost to a national quarrel, till the king slept in, and took it up
himself.&mdash;The Lord Bruce had summoned Sir Edward Sackville (afterward
earl of Dorset), into France, with a fatal compliment, to take death
from his hand.<a name="FNanchor_A_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_97"><sup>[A]</sup></a> <i>And the much lamented Sir James Stuart, one of the
king's blood, and Sir George Wharton, the prime branch of that noble
family, for little worthless punctilios of honor (being intimate
friends), took the field, and fell together by each others
hand.&quot;</i>&mdash;WILSON'S Life of James VI. p. 60.</p>

<a name="Footnote_A_97"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_97">[A]</a><div class="note"><p> See an account of this desperate duel in the <i>Guardian</i>.</p></div>

<p>The sufferers in this melancholy affair were both men of high birth, the
heirs apparent of two noble families, and youths of the most promising
expectation. Sir James Stuart was a knight of the Bath, and eldest
son of Walter, first lord Blantyre, by Nicolas, daughter of Sir James
Somerville, of Cambusnethan. Sir George Wharton was also a knight of the
Bath, and eldest son of Philip, lord Wharton, by Frances, daughter of
Henry Clifford, earl of Cumberland. He married Anne, daughter of the
earl of Rutland, but left no issue.</p>

<p>The circumstances of the quarrel and combat are accurately detailed in
the ballad, of which there exists a black-letter copy in the Pearson
Collection, now in the library of the late John duke of Roxburghe,
entitled, &quot;A Lamentable Ballad, of a Combate, lately fought, near
London, between Sir James Stewarde, and Sir George Wharton, knights,
who were both slain at that time.&mdash;To the tune of, <i>Down Plumpton Park,
&amp;c</i>.&quot; A copy of this ballad has been published in Mr Ritson's <i>Ancient
Songs</i>, and, upon comparison, appears very little different from that
which has been preserved by tradition in Ettrick Forest. Two verses have
been added, and one considerably improved, from Mr Ritson's edition.
These three stanzas are the fifth and ninth of Part First, and the
penult verse of Part Second. I am thus particular, that the reader may
be able, if he pleases, to compare the traditional ballad with the
original edition. It furnishes striking evidence, that, &quot;without
characters, fame lives long.&quot; The difference, chiefly to be remarked
betwixt the copies, lies in the dialect, and in some modifications
applicable to Scotland; as, using the words <i>&quot;Our Scottish Knight.&quot;</i>
The black-letter ballad, in like manner, terms Wharton <i>&quot;Our English
Knight.&quot;</i> My correspondent, James Hogg, adds the following note to this
ballad: &quot;I have heard this song sung by several old people; but all
of them with this tradition, that Wharton bribed Stuart's second, and
actually fought in armour. I acknowledge, that, from some dark hints in
the song, this appears not impossible; but, that you may not judge
too rashly, I must remind you, that the old people, inhabiting the
head-lands (high grounds) hereabouts, although possessed of many
original songs, traditions, and anecdotes, are most unreasonably partial
when the valour or honour of a Scotsman is called in question.&quot; I
retain this note, because it is characteristic; but I agree with my
correspondent, there can be no foundation for the tradition, except in
national partiality.</p>

<p>THE DUEL OF WHARTON AND STUART.</p>

<p>PART FIRST.</p>


<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It grieveth me to tell you o'</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Near London late what did befal,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Twixt two young gallant gentlemen;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">It grieveth me, and ever shall.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One of them was Sir George Wharton,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">My good Lord Wharton's son and heir;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The other, James Stuart, a Scottish knight,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">One that a valiant heart did bear.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When first to court these nobles came,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">One night, a gaining, fell to words;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in their fury grew so hot,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">That they did both try their keen swords.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No manner of treating, nor advice,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Could hold from striking in that place;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For, in the height and heat of blood,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">James struck George Wharton on the face.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;What doth this mean,&quot; George Wharton said,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;To strike in such unmanly sort?</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But, that I take it at thy hands,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;The tongue of man shall ne'er report!&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But do thy worst, then,&quot; said Sir James,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Now do thy worst! appoint a day!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;There's not a lord in England breathes</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Shall gar me give an inch of way.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Ye brag right weel,&quot; George Wharton said;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Let our brave lords at large alane,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And speak of me, that am thy foe;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;For you shall find enough o' ane!</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I'll alterchange my glove wi' thine;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;I'll show it on the bed o' death;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I mean the place where we shall fight;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;There ane or both maun lose life and breath!&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;We'll meet near Waltham,&quot; said Sir James;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;To-morrow, that shall be the day.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;We'll either take a single man,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And try who bears the bell away.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then down together hands they shook,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Without any envious sign;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then went to Ludgate, where they lay,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And each man drank his pint of wine.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No kind of envy could be seen,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">No kind of malice they did betray;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But a' was clear and calm as death,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Whatever in their bosoms lay,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till parting time; and then, indeed,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">They shew'd some rancour in their heart;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Next time we meet,&quot; says George Wharton,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Not half sae soundly we shall part!&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So they have parted, firmly bent</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Their valiant minds equal to try:</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The second part shall clearly show,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Both how they meet, and how they dye.</span><br>

<br>

<p>THE DUEL OF WHARTON AND STUART.</p>

<p>PART SECOND.</p>


<span style="margin-left: 1em;">George Wharton was the first ae man,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Came to the appointed place that day,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where he espyed our Scots lord coming,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">As fast as he could post away.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They met, shook hands; their cheeks were pale;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Then to George Wharton James did say,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I dinna like your doublet, George,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;It stands sae weel on you this day.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Say, have you got no armour on?</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Have ye no under robe of steel?</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I never saw an English man</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Become his doublet half sae weel.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Fy no! fy no!&quot; George Wharton said,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;For that's the thing that mauna be,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;That I should come wi' armour on,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And you a naked man truly.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Our men shall search our doublets, George,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And see if one of us do lie;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Then will we prove, wi' weapons sharp,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Ourselves true gallants for to be.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then they threw off their doublets both,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And stood up in their sarks o' lawn;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Now, take my counsel,&quot; said Sir James,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Wharton, to thee I'll make it knawn:</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;So as we stand, so will we fight;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Thus naked in our sarks,&quot; said he;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Fy no! fy no!&quot; George Wharton says;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;That is the thing that must not be.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;We're neither drinkers, quarrellers,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Nor men that cares na for oursel;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Nor minds na what we're gaun about,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Or if we're gaun to heav'n or hell.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Let us to God bequeath our souls,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Our bodies to the dust and clay!&quot;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With that he drew his deadly sword,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The first was drawn on field that day.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Se'en bouts and turns these heroes had,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Or e'er a drop o' blood was drawn;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our Scotch lord, wond'ring, quickly cry'd,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Stout Wharton! thou still hauds thy awn!&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The first stroke that George Wharton gae,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">He struck him thro' the shoulder-bane;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The neist was thro' the thick o' the thigh;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">He thought our Scotch lord had been slain.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Oh! ever alak!&quot; George Wharton cry'd,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Art thou a living man, tell me?</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;If there's a surgeon living can,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;He'se cure thy wounds right speedily.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;No more of that!&quot; James Stuart said;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Speak not of curing wounds to me!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;For one of us must yield our breath,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Ere off the field one foot we flee.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They looked oure their shoulders both,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To see what company was there;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They both had grievous marks of death,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">But frae the other nane wad steer.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">George Wharton was the first that fell;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Our Scotch lord fell immediately:</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They both did cry to Him above,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To save their souls, for they boud die.</span><br>

<br>

<p>THE LAMENT OF THE BORDER WIDOW.</p>
<br>

<p>This fragment, obtained from recitation in the Forest of Ettrick, is
said to relate to the execution of Cokburne of Henderland, a border
freebooter, hanged over the gate of his own tower by James V., in the
course of that memorable expedition, in 1529, which was fatal to Johnie
Armstrang, Adam Scott of Tushielaw, and many other marauders. The
vestiges of the castle of Henderland are still to be traced upon the
farm of that name, belonging to Mr Murray of Henderland. They are
situated near the mouth of the river Meggat, which falls into the lake
of St Mary, in Selkirkshire. The adjacent country, which now hardly
bears a single tree, is celebrated by Lesly, as, in his time, affording
shelter to the largest stags in Scotland. A mountain torrent, called
Henderland Burn, rushes impetuously from the hills, through a rocky
chasm, named the Dow-glen, and passes near the site of the tower. To the
recesses of this glen the wife of Cokburne is said to have retreated,
during the execution of her husband; and a place, called the <i>Lady's
Seat</i>, is still shewn, where she is said to have striven to drown, amid
the roar of a foaming cataract, the tumultuous noise, which announced
the close of his existence. In a deserted burial-place, which once
surrounded the chapel of the castle, the monument of Cokburne and his
lady is still shewn. It is a large stone, broken into three parts; but
some armorial bearings may be yet traced, and the following inscription
is still legible, though defaced:</p>

<p>HERE LYES PERYS OF COKBURNE AND HIS WYFE MARJORY.</p>

<p>Tradition says, that Cokburne was surprised by the king, while sitting
at dinner. After the execution, James marched rapidly forward, to
surprise Adam Scott of Tushielaw, called the King of the Border, and
sometimes the King of Thieves. A path through the mountains, which
separate the vale of Ettrick from the head of Yarrow, is still called
the <i>King's Road</i>, and seems to have been the rout which he followed.
The remains of the tower of Tushielaw are yet visible, overhanging the
wild banks of the Ettrick; and are an object of terror to the benighted
peasant, from an idea of their being haunted by spectres. From these
heights, and through the adjacent county of Peebles, passes a wild path,
called still the <i>Thief's Road</i>, from having been used chiefly by the
marauders of the border.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My love he built me a bonny bower,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And clad it a' wi' lilye flour;</span><br>

<br>

<p>FAIR HELEN OF KIRCONNELL.</p>
<br>

<p>The following very popular ballad has been handed down by tradition in
its present imperfect state. The affecting incident, on which it is
founded, is well known. A lady, of the name of Helen Irving, or Bell,<a name="FNanchor_A_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_99"><sup>[A]</sup></a>
(for this is disputed by the two clans) daughter of the laird of
Kirconnell, in Dumfries-shire, and celebrated for her beauty, was
beloved by two gentlemen in the neighbourhood. The name of the favoured
suitor was Adam Fleming, of Kirkpatrick; that of the other has escaped
tradition; though it has been alleged, that he was a Bell, of Blacket
House. The addresses of the latter were, however, favoured by the
friends of the lady, and the lovers were therefore obliged to meet in
secret, and by night, in the church-yard of Kirconnell, a romantic spot,
surrounded by the river Kirtle. During one of those private interviews,
the jealous and despised lover suddenly appeared on the opposite bank of
the stream, and levelled his carabine at the breast of his rival. Helen
threw herself before her lover, received in her bosom the bullet, and
died in his arms. A desperate and mortal combat ensued between Fleming
and the murderer, in which the latter was cut to pieces. Other accounts
say, that Fleming pursued his enemy to Spain, and slew him in the
streets of Madrid.</p>

<a name="Footnote_A_99"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_99">[A]</a><div class="note"><p> This dispute is owing to the uncertain date of the ballad;
for, although the last proprietors if Kirconnell were Irvings, when
deprived of their possession by Robert Maxwell in 1600, yet Kirconnell
is termed in old chronicles <i>The Bell's Tower;</i> and a stone, with the
arms of that family, has been found among its ruins. Fair Helen's
sirname, therefore, depends upon the period at which she lived, which it
is now impossible to ascertain.</p></div>

<p>The ballad, as now published, consists of two parts. The first seems to
be an address, either by Fleming or his rival, to the lady; if, indeed,
it constituted any portion of the original poem. For the editor cannot
help suspecting, that these verses have been the production of a
different and inferior bard, and only adapted to the original measure
and tune. But this suspicion, being unwarranted by any copy he has been
able to procure, he does not venture to do more than intimate his own
opinion. The second part, by far the most beautiful, and which is
unquestionably original, forms the lament of Fleming over the grave of
fair Helen.</p>

<p>The ballad is here given, without alteration or improvement, from the
most accurate copy which could be recovered. The fate of Helen has not,
however, remained unsung by modern bards. A lament, of great poetical
merit, by the learned historian Mr Pinkerton, with several other poems
on this subject, have been printed in various forms.</p>

<p>The grave of the lovers is yet shewn in the church-yard of Kirconnell,
near Springkell. Upon the tomb-stone can still be read&mdash;<i>Hie jacet
Adamus Fleming;</i> a cross and sword are sculptured on the stone. The
former is called, by the country people, the gun with which Helen was
murdered; and the latter, the avenging sword of her lover. <i>Sit illis
terra levis!</i> A heap of stones is raised on the spot where the murder
was committed; a token of abhorrence common to most nations.<a name="FNanchor_A_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_100"><sup>[A]</sup></a></p>

<a name="Footnote_A_100"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_100">[A]</a><div class="note"><p> This practice has only very lately become obsolete in
Scotland. The editor remembers, that, a few years ago, a cairn was
pointed out to him in the King's Park of Edinburgh, which had been
raised in detestation of a cruel murder, perpetrated by one Nicol
Muschet, on the body of his wife, in that place, in the year 1720.</p></div>

<p>FAIR HELEN.</p>

<p>HUGHIE THE GRAEME.</p>
<br>

<p>The Graemes, as we have had frequent occasion to notice, were a powerful
and numerous clan, who chiefly inhabited the Debateable Land. They were
said to be of Scottish extraction, and their chief claimed his descent
from Malice, earl of Stratherne. In military service, they were more
attached to England than to Scotland; but, in their depredations on both
countries, they appear to have been very impartial; for, in the year
1600, the gentlemen of Cumberland alleged to Lord Scroope, &quot;that the
Graemes, and their clans, with their children, tenants, and servants,
were the chiefest actors in the spoil and decay of the country.&quot;
Accordingly, they were, at that time, obliged to give a bond of surety
for each other's peaceable demeanour; from which bond, their numbers
appear to have exceeded four hundred men.&mdash;See <i>Introduction to</i>
NICOLSON'S <i>History of Cumberland,</i> p. cviii.</p>

<p>Richard Graeme, of the family of Netherbye, was one of the attendants
upon Charles I., when prince of Wales, and accompanied him upon his
romantic journey through France and Spain. The following little
anecdote, which then occurred, will shew, that the memory of the
Graemes' border exploits was at that time still preserved.</p>

<p>&quot;They were now entered into the deep time of Lent, and could get no
flesh in their inns. Whereupon fell out a pleasant passage, if I may
insert it, by the way, among more serious. There was, near Bayonne,
a herd of goats, with their young ones; upon the sight whereof, Sir
Richard Graham tells the marquis (of Buckingham), that he would snap one
of the kids, and make some shift to carry him snug to their lodging.
Which the prince overhearing, 'Why, Richard,' says he, 'do you think you
may practise here your old tricks upon the borders?' Upon which words,
they, in the first place, gave the goat-herd good contentment; and then,
while the marquis and Richard, being both on foot, were chasing the kid
about the stack, the prince, from horseback, killed him in the head,
with a Scottish pistol.&mdash;Which circumstance, though trifling, may yet
serve to shew how his Royal Highness, even in such slight and sportful
damage, had a noble sense of just dealing.&quot;&mdash;<i>Sir</i> HENRY WOTTON'S <i>Life
of the Duke of Buckingham.</i></p>

<p>I find no traces of this particular Hughie Graeme, of the ballad; but,
from the mention of the <i>Bishop</i>, I suspect he may have been one, of
about four hundred borderers, against whom bills of complaint were
exhibited to Robert Aldridge, lord bishop of Carlisle, about 1553, for
divers incursions, burnings, murders, mutilations, and spoils, by them
committed.&mdash;NICHOLSON'S <i>History, Introduction</i>, lxxxi. There appear
a number of Graemes, in the specimen which we have of that list of
delinquents. There occur, in particular,</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ritchie Grame of Bailie,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will's Jock Grame,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fargue's Willie Grame,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Muckle Willie Grame,</span><br>

<p>with many others.</p>

<p>In Mr Ritson's curious and valuable collection of legendary poetry,
entitled <i>Ancient Songs</i>, he has published this Border ditty, from a
collation of two old black-letter copies, one in the collection of the
late John duke of Roxburghe, and another in the hands of John Bayne,
Esq.&mdash;The learned editor mentions another copy, beginning, &quot;Good Lord
John is a hunting gone.&quot; The present edition was procured for me by
my friend Mr W. Laidlaw, in Blackhouse, and has been long current in
Selkirkshire. Mr Ritson's copy has occasionally been resorted to for
better readings.</p>

<p>HUGHIE THE GRAEME.</p>


<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gude Lord Scroope's to the hunting gane,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">He has ridden o'er moss and muir;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he has grippit Hughie the Graeme,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">For stealing o' the Bishop's mare.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Now, good Lord Scroope, this may not be!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Here hangs a broad sword by my side;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And if that thou canst conquer me,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;The matter it may soon be tryed.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I ne'er was afraid of a traitor thief;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Although thy name be Hughie the Graeme,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I'll make thee repent thee of thy deeds,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;If God but grant me life and time.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Then do your worst now, good Lord Scroope,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And deal your blows as hard as you can!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;It shall be tried, within an hour,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Which of us two is the better man.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But as they were dealing their blows so free,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And both so bloody at the time,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Over the moss came ten yeomen so tall,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">All for to take brave Hughie the Graeme.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then they hae grippit Hughie the Graeme,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And brought him up through Carlisle town;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The lasses and lads stood on the walls,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Crying, &quot;Hughie the Graeme, thou'se ne'er gae down!&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then hae they chosen a jury of men,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And twelve of them cried out at once,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Hughie the Graeme, thou must gae down!&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then up bespake him gude Lord Hume,<a name="FNanchor_B_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_103"><sup>[B]</sup></a></span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;If you'll grant Hughie the Graeme to me.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;For sooth and sae it manna be;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;For, were there but three Graemes of the name,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Twas up and spake the gude Lady Hume,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A peck of white pennies, my gude lord judge,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Were he but the one Graeme of the name,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;He suld be hanged high for me.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;If I be guilty,&quot; said Hughie the Graeme,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Of me my friends shall hae small talk;&quot;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he has loup'd fifteen feet and three,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Though his hands they were tied behind his back.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He looked over his left shoulder,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And for to see what he might see;</span><br>

<p>NOTE ON HUGHIE THE GRAEME.</p>
<br>

<p><i>And wi' the Bishop thou play'd the whore.</i>&mdash;P. 326, v. 9.</p>

<p>Of the morality of Robert Aldridge, bishop of Carlisle, we know but
little; but his political and religious faith were of a stretching and
accommodating texture. Anthony a Wood observes, that there were many
changes in his time, both in church and state; but that the worthy
prelate retained his offices and preferments during them all.</p>

<br>

<p>JOHNIE OF BREADISLEE.</p>

<p>AN ANCIENT NITHESDALE BALLAD.</p>
<br>

<p>The hero of this ballad appears to have been an outlaw and
deer-stealer&mdash;probably one of the broken men residing upon the border.
There are several different copies, in one of which the principal
personage is called <i>Johnie of Cockielaw</i>. The stanzas of greatest merit
have been selected from each copy. It is sometimes said, that this
outlaw possessed the old castle of Morton, in Dumfries-shire, now
ruinous:&mdash;&quot;Near to this castle there was a park, built by Sir Thomas
Randolph, on the face of a very great and high hill; so artificially,
that, by the advantage of the hill, all wild beasts, such as deers,
harts, and roes, and hares, did easily leap in, but could not get out
again; and if any other cattle, such as cows, sheep, or goats, did
voluntarily leap in, or were forced to do it, <i>it is doubted</i> if their
owners were permitted to get them out again.&quot;&mdash;<i>Account of Presbytery
of Penpont, apud Macfarlane's MSS.</i> Such a park would form a convenient
domain to an outlaw's castle, and the mention of Durrisdeer, a
neighbouring parish, adds weight to the tradition. I have seen, on a
mountain near Callendar, a sort of pinfold, composed of immense rocks,
piled upon each other, which, I was told, was anciently constructed for
the above-mentioned purpose. The mountain is thence called <i>Uah var</i>, or
the <i>Cove of the Giant</i>.</p>

<br>

<p>JOHNIE OF BREADISLEE.</p>

<p>AN ANCIENT NITHISDALE BALLAD.</p>


<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Johnie rose up in a May morning,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Called for water to wash his hands&mdash;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Gar loose to me the gude graie dogs</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;That are bound wi' iron bands,&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When Johnie's mother gat word o' that,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Her hands for dule she wrang&mdash;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;O Johnie! for my benison,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To hunt the dun deer down.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As he came down by Merriemass,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And in by the benty line,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And wi' these he has feasted his bludy hounds,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">As if they had been erl's sons.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They eat sae much o' the venison,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And drank sae much o' the blude,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That Johnie and a' his bludy hounds</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Fell asleep, as they had been dead.</span><br>

<p>KATHERINE JANFARIE.</p>
<br>

<p><i>The Ballad was published in the first edition of this work, under the
title of</i> &quot;The Laird of Laminton.&quot; <i>It is now given in a more perfect
state, from several recited copies. The residence of the Lady, and the
scene of the affray at her bridal, is said, by old people, to have been
upon the banks of the Cadden, near to where it joins the Tweed. Others
say the skirmish was fought near Traquair, and</i> KATHERINE JANFARIE'S
<i>dwelling was in the glen, about three miles above Traquair house.</i></p>


<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There was a may, and a weel far'd may.,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her name was Katherine Janfarie,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">She was courted by mony men.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Up then came Lord Lauderdale,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Up frae the Lawland border;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he has come to court this may,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">A' mounted in good order.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He told na her father, he told na her mother,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And he told na ane o' her kin;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But he whisper'd the bonnie lassie hersel',</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And has her favour won.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But out then cam Lord Lochinvar,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Out frae the English border,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All for to court this bonnie may,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Weil mounted, and in order.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He told her father, he told her mother,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And a' the lave o' her kin;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But he told na the bonnie may hersel',</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Till on her wedding e'en.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She sent to the Lord of Lauderdale,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Gin he wad come and see;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he has sent word back again,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Weel answered she suld be.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he has sent a messenger</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Right quickly through the land,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And raised mony an armed man</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To be at his command.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The bride looked out at a high window,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Beheld baith dale and down,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And she was aware of her first true love,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">With riders mony a one.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She scoffed him, and scorned him,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Upon her wedding day;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And said&mdash;&quot;It was the Fairy court</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I come na here to fight,&quot; he said,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;I come na here to play;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I'll but lead a dance wi' the bonnie bride,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And mount and go my way.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It is a glass of the blood-red wine</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Was filled up them between,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And aye she drank to Lauderdale,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Wha her true love had been.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He's ta'en her by the milk-white hand,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And by the grass-green sleeve;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He's mounted her hie behind himsell,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">At her kinsmen spear'd na leave.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Now take your bride, Lord Lochinvar!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Now take her if you may!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But, if you take your bride again,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;We'll call it but foul play.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There were four-and-twenty bonnie boys,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Bid them mount and ride awa'.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then whingers flew frae gentles' sides,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And swords flew frae the shea's,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And red and rosy was the blood</span><br>

<p>THE LAIRD O' LOGIE</p>
<br>

<p>An edition of this ballad is current, under the title of &quot;The Laird of
Ochiltree;&quot; but the editor, since publication of this work, has been
fortunate enough to recover the following more correct and ancient copy,
as recited by a gentleman residing near Biggar. It agrees more nearly,
both in the name and in the circumstances, with the real fact, than the
printed ballad of Ochiltree.</p>

<p>In the year 1592, Francis Stuart, earl of Bothwell, was agitating his
frantic and ill-concerted attempts against the person of James VI.,
whom he endeavoured to surprise in the palace of Falkland. Through the
emulation and private rancour of the courtiers, he found adherents even
about the king's person; among whom, it seems, was the hero of our
ballad, whose history is thus narrated in that curious and valuable
chronicle, of which the first part has been published under the title
of &quot;The Historie of &quot;King James the Sext,&quot; and the second is now in the
press.</p>

<p>&quot;In this close tyme it fortunit, that a gentelman, callit Weymis of
Logye, being also in credence at court, was delatit as a traffekker with
Frances Erle Bothwell; and he being examinat before king and counsall,
confessit his accusation to be of veritie, that sundrie tymes he had
spokin with him, expresslie aganis the king's inhibitioun proclamit in
the contrare, whilk confession he subscryvit with his hand; and because
the event of this mater had sik a succes, it sall also be praysit be
my pen, as a worthie turne, proceiding frome honest chest loove and
charitie, whilk suld on na wayis be obscurit from the posteritie for the
gude example; and therefore I have thought gude to insert the same for a
perpetual memorie.</p>

<p>&quot;Queen Anne, our noble princess, was servit with dyverss gentilwemen
of hir awin cuntrie, and naymelie with are callit Mres Margaret
Twynstoun,<a name="FNanchor_A_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_110"><sup>[A]</sup></a> to whome this gentilman, Weymes of Logye, bure great
honest affection, tending to the godlie band of marriage, the whilk was
honestlie requytet be the said gentilwoman, yea evin in his greatest
mister; for howsone she understude the said gentilman to be in distress,
and apperantlie be his confession to be puueist to the death, and she
having prevelege to ly in the queynis chalmer that same verie night of
his accusation, whare the king was also reposing that same night, she
came forth of the dur prevelie, bayth the prencis being then at quyet
rest, and past to the chalmer, whare the said gentilman was put
in custodie to certayne of the garde, and commandit thayme that
immediatelie he sould be broght to the king and queyne, whareunto thay
geving sure credence, obeyit. Bot howsone she was cum bak to the chalmer
dur, she desyrit the watches to stay till he sould cum furth agayne, and
so she closit the dur, and convoyit the gentilman to a windo', whare she
ministrat a long corde unto him to convoy himself doun upon; and sa,
be hir gude cheritable help, he happelie escapit be the subteltie of
loove.&quot;</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">If ye will hearken unto me;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The king has ta'en a poor prisoner,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The wanton laird o' young Logie.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Young Logie's laid in Edinburgh chapel;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Carmichael's the keeper o' the key;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And may Margaret's lamenting sair,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Lament, lament na, may Margaret,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And of your weeping let me be;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;For ye maun to the king himsell,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;To seek the life of young Logie.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And she has curl'd back her yellow hair&mdash;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;If I canna get young Logie's life,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Fareweel to Scotland for evermair.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When she came before the king,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She knelit lowly on her knee&mdash;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;O what's the matter, may Margaret?</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And what needs a' this courtesie?&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;A boon, a boon, my noble liege,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;A boon, a boon, I beg o' thee!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And the first boon that I come to crave,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Is to grant me the life of young Logic.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;O na, O na, may Margaret,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Forsooth, and so it manna be;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;For a' the gowd o' fair Scotland</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Shall not save the life of young Logie.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But she has stown the king's redding kaim,<a name="FNanchor_A_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_111"><sup>[A]</sup></a></span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Likewise the queen her wedding knife;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sent the tokens to Carmichael,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To cause young Logic get his life.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She sent him a purse o' the red gowd,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Another o' the white monie;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She sent him a pistol for each hand,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And bade him shoot when he gat free.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When he came to the tolbooth stair,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">There he let his volley flee;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It made the king in his chamber start,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">E'en in the bed where he might be.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Gae out, gae out, my merrymen a',</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And bid Carmichael come speak to me;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;For I'll lay my life the pledge o' that,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;That yon's the shot o' young Logie.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When Carmichael came before the king,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">He fell low down upon his knee;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The very first word that the king spake,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Was&mdash;&quot;Where's the laird of young Logie?&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Carmichael turn'd him round about,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">(I wot the tear blinded his eye)</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;There came a token frae your grace,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And hast thou play'd me that?&quot; quoth he;</span><br>

<p>NOTE ON THE LAIRD O' LOGIE.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Carmichael's the keeper o' the key.</i>&mdash;P. 344. v. 2.</p>

<p>Sir John Carmichael of Carmichael, the hero of the ballad, called the
Raid of the Reidswair, was appointed captain of the king's guard in
1588, and usually had the keeping of state criminals of rank.</p>

<br>

<p>A LYKE-WAKE DIRGE.</p>
<br>

<p>This is a sort of charm, sung by the lower ranks of Roman Catholics, in
some parts of the north of England, while watching a dead body, previous
to interment. The tune is doleful and monotonous, and, joined to the
mysterious import of the words, has a solemn effect. The word <i>sleet</i>,
in the chorus, seems to be corrupted from <i>selt</i>, or salt; a quantity of
which, in compliance with a popular superstition, is frequently placed
on the breast of a corpse.</p>

<p>The mythologic ideas of the dirge are common to various creeds. The
Mahometan believes, that, in advancing to the final judgment seat, he
must traverse a bar of red-hot iron, stretched across a bottomless
gulph. The good works of each true believer, assuming a substantial
form, will then interpose betwixt his feet and this <i>&quot;Bridge of Dread;&quot;</i>
but the wicked, having no such protection, must fall headlong into the
abyss.&mdash;D'HERBELOT, <i>Bibiotheque Orientale</i>.</p>

<p>Passages, similar to this dirge, are also to be found in <i>Lady Culross's
Dream</i>, as quoted in the second Dissertation prefixed by Mr Pinkerton
to his <i>Select Scottish Ballads</i>, 2 vols. The dreamer journeys towards
heaven, accompanied and assisted by a celestial guide:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through dreadful dens, which made my heart aghast,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He bare me up when I began to tire.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sometimes we clamb o'er craggy mountains high.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sometimes stay'd on uglie braes of sand:</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They were so stay that wonder was to see;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But, when I fear'd, he held me by the hand.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through great deserts we wandered on our way&mdash;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Forward we passed on narrow bridge of trie,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O'er waters great, which hediously did roar.</span><br>

<p>Again, she supposes herself suspended over an infernal gulph:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ere I was ware, one gripped me at the last,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And held me high above a naming fire.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fire was great; the heat did pierce me sore;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My faith grew weak.; my grip was very small;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I trembled fast; my fear grew more and more.</span><br>

<p>A horrible picture of the same kind, dictated probably by the author's
unhappy state of mind, is to be found in Brooke's <i>Fool of Quality</i>. The
dreamer, a ruined female, is suspended over the gulph of perdition by
a single hair, which is severed by a demon, who, in the form of her
seducer springs upwards from the flames.</p>

<p>The Russian funeral service, without any allegorical imagery, expresses
the sentiment of the dirge in language alike simple and noble.</p>

<p>&quot;Hast thou pitied the afflicted, O man? In death shalt thou be pitied.
Hast thou consoled the orphan? The orphan will deliver thee.
Hast thou clothed the naked? The naked will procure thee
protection.&quot;&mdash;RICHARDSON'S <i>Anecdotes of Russia.</i></p>

<p>But the most minute description of the <i>Brig o' Dread</i>, occurs in the
legend of <i>Sir Owain</i>, No. XL. in the MS. Collection of Romances, W.
4.1. Advocates' Library, Edinburgh; though its position is not the same
as in the dirge, which may excite a suspicion that the order of the
stanzas in the latter has been transposed. Sir Owain, a Northumbrian
knight, after many frightful adventures in St Patrick's purgatory, at
last arrives at the bridge, which, in the legend, is placed betwixt
purgatory and paradise:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fendes han the knight ynome,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To a stinkand water thai ben ycome,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He no seigh never er non swiche;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It stank fouler than ani hounde.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And maui mile it was to the grounde.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And was as swart as piche.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Owain seigh ther ouer ligge</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A swithe strong naru brigge:</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The fendes seyd tho;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Lo! sir knight, sestow this?</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;This is the brigge of paradis,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Here ouer thou must go.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And we the schul with stones prowe,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And the winde the schul ouer blow,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;And wirche the full wo;</span><br>

<br>

<p>THE DOWIE DENS OF YARROW.</p>

<p>NOW FIRST PUBLISHED.</p>
<br>

<p>This ballad, which is a very great favourite among the inhabitants of
Ettrick Forest, is universally believed to be founded in fact. The
editor found it easy to collect a variety of copies; but very difficult,
indeed, to select from them such a collated edition, as may, in any
degree, suit the taste of &quot;these more light and giddy-paced times.&quot;</p>

<p>Tradition places the event, recorded in the song, very early; and it
is probable that the ballad was composed soon afterwards, although
the language has been gradually modernized, in the course of
its transmission to us, through the inaccurate channel of oral
tradition.&mdash;The bard does not relate particulars, but barely the
striking outlines of a fact, apparently so well known when he wrote,
as to render minute detail as unnecessary, as it is always tedious and
unpoetical.</p>

<p>The hero of the ballad was a knight of great bravery, called Scott,
who is said to have resided at Kirkhope, or Oakwood castle, and is, in
tradition, termed the Baron of Oakwood. The estate of Kirkhope belonged
anciently to the Scotts of Harden: Oakwood is still their property,
and has been so from time immemorial. The editor was therefore led to
suppose, that the hero of the ballad might have been identified with
John Scott, sixth son of the laird of Harden, murdered in Ettrick
Forest by his kinsmen, the Scotts of Gilmanscleugh (see notes to <i>Jamie
Telfer</i>, Vol. I. p. 152). This appeared the more probable, as the common
people always affirm, that this young man was treacherously slain, and
that, in evidence thereof, his body remained uncorrupted for many years;
so that even the roses on his shoes seemed as fresh as when he was first
laid in the family vault at Hassendean. But from a passage in Nisbet's
Heraldry, he now believes the ballad refers to a duel fought at
Deucharswyre, of which Annan's Treat is a part, betwixt John Scott of
Tushielaw and his brother-in-law Walter Scott, third son of Robert of
Thirlestane, in which the latter was slain.</p>

<p>In ploughing Annan's Treat, a huge monumental stone, with an
inscription, was discovered; but being rather scratched than engraved,
and the lines being run through each other, it is only possible to
read one or two Latin words. It probably records the event of the
combat.&mdash;The person slain was the male ancestor of the present Lord
Napier.</p>

<p>Tradition affirms, that the hero of the song (be he who he may) was
murdered by the brother, either of his wife, or betrothed bride. The
alleged cause of malice was, the lady's father having proposed to endow
her with half of his property, upon her marriage with a warrior of such
renown. The name of the murderer is said to have been Annan, and the
place of combat is still called Annan's Treat. It is a low muir, on the
banks of the Yarrow, lying to the west of Yarrow Kirk. Two tall unhewn
masses of stone are erected, about eighty yards distant from each other;
and the least child, that can herd a cow, will tell the passenger, that
there lie &quot;the two lords, who were slain in single combat.&quot;</p>

<p>It will be, with many readers, the greatest recommendation of these
verses, that they are supposed to have suggested to Mr Hamilton, of
Bangour, the modern ballad, beginning,</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Busk ye, busk ye, my bonny bonny bride.&quot;</span><br>

<p>A fragment, apparently regarding the story of the following ballad, but
in a different measure, occurs in Mr Herd's MSS., and runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;When I look cast, my heart is sair,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But when I look west, its mair and mair;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;For then I see the braes o' Yarrow,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And there, for aye, I lost my marrow.&quot;</span><br>

<br>

<p>THE DOWIE DENS OF YARROW.</p>


<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Late at e'en, drinking the wine,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And ere they paid the lawing,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They set a combat them between,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To fight it in the dawing.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;O stay at hame, my noble lord!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;O stay at hame, my marrow!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;My cruel brother will you betray</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;On the dowie houms of Yarrow.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;O fare ye weel, my ladye gaye!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;O fare ye weel, my Sarah!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;For I maun gae, though I ne'er return,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Frae the dowie banks o' Yarrow.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She kissed his cheek, she kaimed his hair,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">As oft she had done before, O;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She belted him with his noble brand,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And he's awa' to Yarrow.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As he gaed up the Tennies bank,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">I wot he gaed wi' sorrow,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till, down in a den, he spied nine arm'd men,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">On the dowie houms of Yarrow.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;O come ye here to part your land,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;The bonnie forest thorough?</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Or come ye here to wield your brand,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;On the dowie houms of Yarrow?&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I come not here to part my land,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And neither to beg nor borrow;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I come to wield my noble brand,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;On the bonnie banks of Yarrow.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;If I see all, ye're nine to ane;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And that's an unequal marrow;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Yet will I fight, while lasts my brand,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;On the bonnie banks of Yarrow.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Four has he hurt, and five has slain,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">On the bloody braes of Yarrow,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till that stubborn knight came him behind,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And ran his bodie thorough.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Gae hame, gae hame, good-brother<a name="FNanchor_A_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_114"><sup>[A]</sup></a> John,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Wi' my true love, on Yarrow.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;O gentle wind, that bloweth south,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;From where my love repaireth,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Convey a kiss from his dear mouth,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And tell me how he fareth!</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But in the glen strive armed men;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;They've wrought me dole and sorrow;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;They've slain&mdash;the comeliest knight they've slain&mdash;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;He bleeding lies on Yarrow.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As she sped down yon high high hill,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">She gaed wi' dole and sorrow,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in the den spyed ten slain men,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">On the dowie banks of Yarrow.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She kissed his cheek, she kaim'd his hair,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">She search'd his wounds all thorough;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She kiss'd them, till her lips grew red,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">On the dowie houms of Yarrow.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Now, haud your tongue, my daughter dear!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;For a' this breeds but sorrow;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I'll wed ye to a better lord,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Than him ye lost on Yarrow.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Ye's tarry there till night.&quot;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And so her father pledged his word,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And so his promise plight.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She has ta'en her to her bigly bour</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">As fast as she could fare;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And she has drank a sleepy draught,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">That she had mixed wi' care.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And pale, pale grew her rosy cheek,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">That was sae bright of blee,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And she seemed to be as surely dead</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">As any one could be.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then spak her cruel step-minnie,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Take ye the burning lead,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And drap a drap on her bosome,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;To try if she be dead.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They took a drap o' boiling lead,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">They drap'd it on her breast;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Alas! alas!&quot; her father cried,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;She's dead without the priest.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She neither chatter'd with her teeth,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Nor shiver'd with her chin;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Alas! alas!&quot; her father cried,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;There is nae breath within.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then up arose her seven brethren,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And hew'd to her a bier;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They hew'd it frae the solid aik,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Laid it o'er wi' silver clear.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then up and gat her seven sisters,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And sewed to her a kell;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And every steek that they pat in</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Sewed to a siller bell.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The first Scots kirk that they cam to,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">They gar'd the bells be rung;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The next Scots kirk that they cam to,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">They gar'd the mass be sung.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But when they cam to St Mary's kirk,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">There stude spearmen, all on a raw;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And up and started Lord William,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The chieftane amang them a'.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Set down, set down the bier,&quot; he said;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Let me looke her upon:&quot;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But as soon as Lord William touched her hand,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Her colour began to come.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She brightened like the lily flower,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Till her pale colour was gone;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With rosy cheik, and ruby lip,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">She smiled her love upon.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;A morsel of your bread, my lord,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And one glass of your wine:</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;For I hae fasted these three lang days,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;All for your sake and mine.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Gae hame, gae hame, my seven bauld brothers!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Gae hame and blaw your horn!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I trow you wad hae gien me the skaith,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;But I've gien you the scorn.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Commend me to my grey father,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;That wish'd, my saul gude rest;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But wae be to my cruel step-dame,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Gar'd burn me on the breast.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Ah! woe to you, you light woman!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;An ill death may you die!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;For we left father and sisters at hame</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Breaking their hearts for thee.&quot;</span><br>

<p>NOTES ON THE GAY GOSS HAWK.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>The red, that's on my true love's cheik,</i></span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Is like blood drops on the snaw.</i>&mdash;P. 362. v, 5.</span><br>

<p>This simile resembles a passage in a MS. translation of an Irish Fairy
tale, called <i>The Adventures of Faravla, Princess of Scotland, and
Carral O'Daly, Son of Donogho More O'Daly, Chief Bard of Ireland.</i></p>

<p>&quot;Faravla, as she entered her bower, cast her looks upon the earth, which
was tinged with the blood of a bird which a raven had newly killed;
'Like that snow,' said Faravla, 'was the complexion of my beloved, his
cheeks like the sanguine traces thereon; whilst the raven recals to my
memory the colour of his beautiful locks.&quot;</p>

<p>There is also some resemblance, in the conduct of the story, betwixt the
ballad and the tale just quoted. The Princess Faravla, being desperately
in love with Carral O'Daly, dispatches in search of him a faithful
confidant, who, by her magical art, transforms herself into a hawk, and,
perching upon the windows of the bard, conveys to him information of the
distress of the princess of Scotland.</p>

<p>In the ancient romance of <i>Sir Tristrem</i>, the simile of the &quot;blood drops
upon snow&quot; likewise occurs:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A bride bright thai ches</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As blod open snoweing.</span><br>

<p>BROWN ADAM.</p>
<br>

<p><i>There is a copy of this Ballad in Mrs.</i> BROWN'S <i>Collection. The Editor
has seen one, printed on a single sheet. The epithet, &quot;Smith,&quot; implies,
probably, the sirname, not the profession, of the hero, who seems to
have been an outlaw There is, however, in Mrs.</i> BROWN'S <i>copy, a verse
of little merit here omitted, alluding to the implements of that
occupation.</i></p>


<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O wha wad wish the wind to blaw,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Or the green leaves fa' therewith?</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">He stude a little forbye,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there he heard a fou fause knight</span><br>

<p>JELLON GRAME.</p>

<p>NEVER BEFORE PUBLISHED.</p>
<br>

<p>This ballad is published from tradition, with some conjectural
emendations. It is corrected by a copy in Mrs Brown's MS., from which
it differs in the concluding stanzas. Some verses are apparently
modernized.</p>

<p><i>Jellon</i> seems to be the same name with <i>Jyllian</i> or <i>Julian</i>. &quot;Jyl of
Brentford's Testament&quot; is mentioned in Warton's <i>History of Poetry,</i>
Vol. II. p. 40. The name repeatedly occurs in old ballads, sometimes as
that of a man, at other times as that of a woman. Of the former is
an instance in the ballad of <i>&quot;Knight and the Shepherd's
Daughter,&quot;&mdash;Reliques of Ancient Poetry,</i> Vol. III. p. 72.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some do call me Jack, sweetheart.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And some do call me <i>Jille</i>.</span><br>

<p>Witton Gilbert, a village four miles west of Durham, is, throughout the
bishopric, pronounced Witton Jilbert. We have also the common name of
Giles, always in Scotland pronounced Jill. For Gille, or Julianna, as
a female name, we have <i>Fair Gillian</i> of Croyden, and a thousand
authorities. Such being the case, the editor must enter his protest
against the conversion of Gil Morrice, into child Maurice, an epithet
of chivalry. All the circumstances in that ballad argue, that the
unfortunate hero was an obscure and very young man, who had never
received the honour of knighthood. At any rate, there can be no reason,
even were internal evidence totally wanting, for altering a well known
proper name, which, till of late years, has been the uniform title of
the ballad.</p>

<br>

<p>JELLON GRAME.</p>


<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O JELLON GRAME sat in Silverwood,<a name="FNanchor_A_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_117"><sup>[A]</sup></a></span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">He sharped his broad sword lang;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he has call'd his little foot page</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">An errand for to gang.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Win up, my bonny boy,&quot; he says,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;As quickly as ye may;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;For ye maun gang for Lillie Flower</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Before the break of day.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The boy has buckled his belt about,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And thro' the green-wood ran;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he cam to the ladye's bower</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Before the day did dawn.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;O sleep ye, wake ye, Lillie Flower?</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;The red sun's on the rain:</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Ye're bidden come to Silverwood,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;But I doubt ye'll never win hame.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She hadna ridden a mile, a mile,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">A mile but barely three,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ere she cam to a new made grave,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Beneath a green aik tree.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O then up started Jellon Grame,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Out of a bush thereby;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Light down, light down, now, Lillie Flower,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;For its here that ye maun lye.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She lighted aff her milk-white steed,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And kneel'd upon her knee;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;O mercy, mercy, Jellon Grame,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;For I'm no prepared to die!</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Your bairn, that stirs between my sides,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Maun shortly see the light;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But to see it weltering in my blood,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Would be a piteous sight.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;O should I spare your life,&quot; he says,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Until that bairn were born,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Full weel I ken your auld father</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Would hang me on the morn.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;O spare my life, now, Jellon Grame!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;My father ye need na dread:</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I'll keep my babe in gude green-wood,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Or wi' it I'll beg my bread.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He took no pity on Lillie Flower,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Tho' she for life did pray;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But pierced her thro' the fair body</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">As at his feet she lay.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He felt nae pity for Lillie Flower,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Where she was lying dead;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But he felt some for the bonny bairn,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">That lay weltering in her bluid.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Up has he ta'en that bonny boy,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Given him to nurses nine;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Three to sleep, and three to wake,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And three to go between.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he bred up that bonny boy,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Called him his sister's son;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he thought no eye could ever see</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The deed that he had done.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O so it fell, upon a day,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">When hunting they might be,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They rested them in Silverwood,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Beneath that green aik tree.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And mony were the green-wood flowers</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Upon the grave that grew,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And marvell'd much that bonny boy</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To see their lovely hue.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;What's paler than the prymrose wan?</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;What's redder than the rose?</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;What's fairer than the lilye flower</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;On this wee know<a name="FNanchor_B_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_118"><sup>[B]</sup></a> that grows?&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O out and answered Jellon Grame,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And he spak hastelie&mdash;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Your mother was a fairer flower,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And lies beneath this tree.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;More pale she was, when she sought my grace,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Than prymrose pale and wan;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And redder than rose her ruddy heart's blood,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;That down my broad sword ran.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wi' that the boy has bent his bow,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">It was baith stout and lang;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thro' and thro' him, Jellon Grame,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">He gar'd an arrow gang.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Says&mdash;&quot;Lie ye there, now, Jellon Grame!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;My malisoun gang you wi'!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;The place my mother lies buried in</span><br>

<p>ANCIENT COPY.</p>

<p>NEVER BEFORE PUBLISHED.</p>
<br>

<p>Mr Lewis, in his <i>Tales of Wonder</i>, has presented the public with a copy
of this ballad, with additions and alterations. The editor has also seen
a copy, containing some modern stanzas, intended by Mr Jamieson, of
Macclesfield, for publication in his Collection of Scottish Poetry. Yet,
under these disadvantages, the editor cannot relinquish his purpose of
publishing the old ballad, in its native simplicity, as taken from Mrs
Brown of Faulkland's MS.</p>

<p>Those, who wish to know how an incantation, or charm, of the distressing
nature here described, was performed in classic days, may consult the
story of Galanthis's Metamorphosis, in Ovid, or the following passage in
Apuleius: <i>&quot;Eadem (Saga scilicet quaedam), amatoris uxorem, quod in sibi
dicacule probrum dixerat, jam in sarcinam praegnationis, obsepto utero,
et repigrato faetu, perpetua praegnatione damnavit. Et ut cuncti
numerant, octo annorum onere, misella illa, velut elephantum paritura,

<p>There is also a curious tale about a count of Westeravia, whom a
deserted concubine bewitched upon his marriage, so as to preclude all
hopes of his becoming a father. The spell continued to operate for
three years, till one day, the count happening to meet with his former
mistress, she maliciously asked him about the increase of his family.
The count, conceiving some suspicion from her manner, craftily answered,
that God had blessed him with three fine children; on which she
exclaimed, like Willie's mother in the ballad, &quot;May Heaven confound
the old hag, by whose counsel I threw an enchanted pitcher into the
draw-well of your palace!&quot; The spell being found, and destroyed, the
count became the father of a numerous family.&mdash;<i>Hierarchie of the
Blessed Angels,</i> p. 474.</p>

<p>CLERK SAUNDERS.</p>

<p>NEVER BEFORE PUBLISHED.</p>
<br>

<p>This romantic ballad is taken from Mr Herd's MSS., with several
corrections from a shorter and more imperfect copy, in the same volume,
and one or two conjectural emendations in the arrangement of the
stanzas. The resemblance of the conclusion to the ballad, beginning,
&quot;There came a ghost to Margaret's door,&quot; will strike every reader.&mdash;The
tale is uncommonly wild and beautiful, and apparently very ancient.
The custom of the passing bell is still kept up in many villages of
Scotland. The sexton goes through the town, ringing a small bell, and
announcing the death of the departed, and the time of the funeral.&mdash;The
three concluding verses have been recovered since the first edition
of this work; and I am informed by the reciter, that it was usual to
separate from the rest, that part of the ballad which follows the death
of the lovers, as belonging to another story. For this, however, there
seems no necessity, as other authorities give the whole as a complete
tale.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Clerk Saunders and may Margaret</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Walked ower yon garden green;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sad and heavy was the love</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">That fell thir twa between.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;A bed, a bed,&quot; Clerk Saunders said,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;A bed for you and me!&quot;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Fye na, fye na,&quot; said may Margaret,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Till anes we married be.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;For in may come my seven bauld brothers,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Wi' torches burning bright;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;They'll say&mdash;'We hae but ae sister,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And behold she's wi' a knight!'</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Then take the sword frae my scabbard,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And slowly lift the pin;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And you may swear, and safe your aith,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Ye never let Clerk Saunders in.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And take a napkin in your hand,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And tie up baith your bonny een;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And you may swear, and safe your aith,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Ye saw me na since late yestreen.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It was about the midnight hour,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">When they asleep were laid,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When in and came her seven brothers,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Wi' torches burning red.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When in and came her seven brothers,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Wi' torches shining bright;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They said, &quot;We hae but ae sister,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And behold her lying with a knight!&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then out and spake the first o' them,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;I bear the sword shall gar him die!&quot;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And out and spake the second o' them,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;His father has nae mair than he!&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And out and spake the third o' them,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;I wot that they are lovers dear!&quot;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And out and spake the fourth o' them,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;They hae been in love this mony a year!&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then out and spake the fifth o' them,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;It were great sin true love to twain!&quot;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And out and spake the sixth o' them,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;It were shame to slay a sleeping man!&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then up and gat the seventh o' them,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And never a word spake he;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But he has striped<a name="FNanchor_A_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_124"><sup>[A]</sup></a> his bright brown brand</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Out through Clerk Saunders' fair bodye.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Clerk Saunders he started, and Margaret she turned</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Into his arms as asleep she lay;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sad and silent was the night</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">That was atween thir twae.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And they lay still and sleeped sound,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Until the day began to daw;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And kindly to him she did say,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;It is time, true love, you were awa'.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But he lay still, and sleeped sound,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Albeit the sun began to sheen;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She looked atween her and the wa',</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And dull and drowsie were his een.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then in and came her father dear,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Said&mdash;&quot;Let a' your mourning be:</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I'll carry the dead corpse to the clay,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And I'll come back and comfort thee.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Comfort weel your seven sons;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The clinking bell gaed through the town,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To carry the dead corse to the clay;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Clerk Saunders stood at may Margaret's window,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">I wot, an hour before the day.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Are ye sleeping, Margaret?&quot; he says,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;It has the smell, now, of the ground;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And if I kiss thy comely mouth,</span><br>

<p><i>Weel set about wi' gillyflowers.</i>&mdash;P. 394. v. 5.</p>

<p>From whatever source the popular ideas of heaven be derived, the mention
of gillyflowers is not uncommon. Thus, in the Dead Men's Song&mdash;</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fields about this city faire</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Were all with roses set;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Gillyflowers</i>, and carnations faire,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Which canker could not fret.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">RITSON'S <i>Ancient Songs</i>, p. 288.</span><br>

<p>The description, given in the legend of <i>Sir Owain</i>, of the terrestrial
paradise, at which the blessed arrive, after passing through purgatory,
omits gillyflowers, though it mentions many others. As the passage is
curious, and the legend has never been published, many persons may not
be displeased to see it extracted&mdash;</p>

<p>The custom of binding the new-laid sod of the church-yard with osiers,
or other saplings, prevailed both in England and Scotland, and served to
protect the turf from injury by cattle, or otherwise. It is alluded to
by Gay, in the <i>What d'ye call it</i>&mdash;</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stay, let me pledge, 'tis my last earthly liquor,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When I am dead you'll bind my grave with <i>wicker</i>.</span><br>

<p>In the <i>Shepherd's Week</i>, the same custom is alluded to, and the cause
explained:&mdash;</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With <i>wicker rods</i> we fenced her tomb around,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To ward, from man and beast, the hallowed ground,</span><br>

<p>NOTES ON EARL RICHARD.</p>


<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>The candles burned bright.</i>&mdash;P. 403. v. 4.</span><br>

<p>These are unquestionably the corpse lights, called in Wales <i>Canhwyllan
Cyrph</i>, which are sometimes seen to illuminate the spot where a dead
body is concealed. The editor is informed, that, some years ago, the
corpse of a man, drowned in the Ettrick, below Selkirk, was discovered
by means of these candles. Such lights are common in churchyards, and
are probably of a phosphoric nature. But rustic superstition derives
them from supernatural agency, and supposes, that, as soon as life has
departed, a pale flame appears at the window of the house, in which the
person had died, and glides towards the church-yard, tracing through
every winding the route of the future funeral, and pausing where the
bier is to rest. This and other opinions, relating to the &quot;tomb-fires'
livid gleam,&quot; seem to be of Runic extraction.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>The deepest pot in a' the linn.</i>&mdash;P. 403. v. 5.</span><br>

<p>The deep holes, scooped in the rock by the eddies of a river, are called
<i>pots;</i> the motion of the water having there some resemblance to a
boiling cauldron.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Linn</i>, means the pool beneath a cataract.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>The maiden touched the clay-cauld corpse,</i></span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>A drop it never bled.</i>&mdash;P. 405. v. I.</span><br>

<p>This verse, which is restored from tradition, refers to a superstition
formerly received in most parts of Europe, and even resorted to, by
judicial authority, for the discovery of murder. In Germany, this
experiment was called <i>bahr-recht</i>, or the law of the bier; because,
the murdered body being stretched upon a bier, the suspected person was
obliged to put one hand upon the wound, and the other upon the mouth
of the deceased, and, in that posture, call upon heaven to attest his
innocence. If, during this ceremony, the blood gushed from the mouth,
nose, or wound, a circumstance not unlikely to happen in the course of
shifting or stirring the body, it was held sufficient evidence of the
guilt of the party.</p>

<p>The same singular kind of evidence, although reprobated by Mathaeus and
Carpzovius, was admitted in the Scottish criminal courts, at the short
distance of one century. My readers may be amused by the following
instances:</p>

<p>&quot;The laird of Auchindrane (Muir of Auchindrane, in Ayrshire) was accused
of a horrid and private murder, where there were no witnesses, and which
the Lord had witnessed from heaven, singularly by his own hand, and
proved the deed against him. The corpse of the man being buried in
Girvan church-yard, as a man cast away at sea, and cast out there, the
laird of Colzean, whose servant he had been, dreaming of him in his
sleep, and that he had a particular mark upon his body, came and took up
the body, and found it to be the same person; and caused all that lived
near by come and touch the corpse, as is usual in such cases. All round
the place came but Auchindrane and his son, whom nobody suspected, till
a young child of his, Mary Muir, seeing the people examined, came in
among them; and, when she came near the dead body, it sprang out
in bleeding; upon which they were apprehended, and put to the
torture.&quot;&mdash;WODROW'S <i>History</i>, Vol. I. p. 513. The trial of Auchindrane
happened in 1611. He was convicted and executed.&mdash;HUME'S <i>Criminal Law</i>,
Vol. I. p. 428.</p>

<p>A yet more dreadful case was that of Philip Standfield, tried upon the
30th November, 1687, for cursing his father (which, by the Scottish law,
is a capital crime, <i>Act 1661, Chap</i>. 20), and for being accessory
to his murder. Sir James Standfield, the deceased, was a person of
melancholy temperament; so that, when his body was found in a pond near
his own house of Newmilns, he was at first generally supposed to have
drowned himself. But, the body having been hastily buried, a report
arose that he had been strangled by ruffians, instigated by his son
Philip, a profligate youth, whom be had disinherited on account of his
gross debauchery. Upon this rumour, the Privy Council granted warrant to
two surgeons of character, named Crawford and Muirhead, to dig up the
body, and to report the state in which they should find it. Philip
was present on this occasion, and the evidence of both surgeons bears
distinctly, that he stood for some time at a distance from the body
of his parent; but, being called upon to assist in stretching out
the corpse, he put his hand to the head, when the mouth and nostrils
instantly gushed with blood. This circumstance, with the evident
symptoms of terror and remorse, exhibited by young Standfield, seem to
have had considerable weight with the jury, and are thus stated in the
indictment: &quot;That his (the deceased's) nearest relations being required
to lift the corpse into the coffin, after it had been inspected, upon
the said Philip Standfield touching of it (<i>according to God's usual
mode of discovering murder</i>), it bled afresh upon the said Philip; and
that thereupon he let the body fall, and fled from it in the greatest
consternation, crying, Lord have mercy upon me!&quot; The prisoner was found
guilty of being accessory to the murder of his father, although there
was little more than strong presumptions against him. It is true, he was
at the same time separately convicted of the distinct crimes of having
cursed his father, and drank damnation to the monarchy and hierarchy.
His sentence, which was to have his tongue cut out, and hand struck off,
previous to his being hanged, was executed with the utmost rigour. He
denied the murder with his last breath. &quot;It is,&quot; says a contemporary
judge, &quot;a dark case of divination, to be remitted to the great day,
whether he was guilty or innocent. Only it is certain he
was a bad youth, and may serve as a beacon to all profligate
persons.&quot;&mdash;FOUNTAINHALL'S <i>Decisions</i>, Vol. I. p. 483.</p>

<p>While all ranks believed alike the existence of these prodigies, the
vulgar were contented to refer them to the immediate interference of the
Deity, or, as they termed it, God's revenge against murder. But those,
who, while they had overleaped the bounds of superstition, were still
entangled in the mazes of mystic philosophy, amongst whom we must
reckon many of the medical practitioners, endeavoured to explain the
phenomenon, by referring to the secret power of sympathy, which even
Bacon did not venture to dispute. To this occult agency was imputed the
cure of wounds, effected by applying salves and powders, not to
the wound itself, but to the sword or dagger, by which it had been
inflicted; a course of treatment, which, wonderful as it may at first
seem, was certainly frequently attended with signal success.<a name="FNanchor_A_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_131"><sup>[A]</sup></a> This,
however, was attributed to magic, and those, who submitted to such a
mode of cure, were refused spiritual assistance.</p>

<a name="Footnote_A_131"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_131">[A]</a><div class="note"><p> The first part of the process was to wash the wound clean,
and bind it up so as to promote adhesion, and exclude the air. Now,
though the remedies, afterwards applied to the sword, could hardly
promote so desirable an issue, yet it is evident the wound stood a good
chance of healing by the operation of nature, which, I believe, medical
gentlemen call a cure by the first intention.</p></div>

<p>The vulgar continue to believe firmly in the phenomenon of the murdered
corpse bleeding at the approach of the murderer. &quot;Many (I adopt the
words of an ingenious correspondent) are the proofs advanced in
confirmation of the opinion, against those who are so hardy as to doubt
it; but one, in particular, as it is said to have happened in this
place, I cannot help repeating.</p>

<p>&quot;Two young men, going a fishing in the river Yarrow, fell out; and so
high ran the quarrel, that the one, in a passion, stabbed the other to
the heart with a fish spear. Astonished &quot;at the rash act, he hesitated
whether to fly, give himself up to justice, or conceal the crime; and,
in the end, fixed on the latter expedient, burying the body of his
friend very deep in the sands. As the meeting had been accidental, he
was never from gaiety to a settled melancholy. Time passed on for
the space of fifty years, when a smith, fishing near the same place,
discovered an uncommon and curious bone, which he put in his pocket,
and afterwards showed to some people in his smithy. The murderer being
present, now an old white-headed man, leaning on his staff, desired a
sight of the little bone; but how horrible was the issue! no sooner had
he touched it, than it streamed with purple blood. Being told where it
was found, he confessed the crime, was condemned, but was prevented, by
death, from suffering the punishment due to his crime.</p>

<p>&quot;Such opinions, though reason forbids us to believe them, a few moments
reflection on the cause of their origin will teach us to revere. Under
the feudal system which prevailed, the rights of humanity were too often
violated, and redress very hard to be procured; thus an awful deference
to one of the leading attributes of Omnipotence begat on the mind,
untutored by philosophy, the first germ of these supernatural effects;
which was, by superstitious zeal, assisted, perhaps, by a few instances
of sudden remorse, magnified into evidence of indisputable guilt.&quot;</p>

<p>Lochroyan, whence this ballad probably derives its name, lies in
Galloway. The lover, who, if the story be real, may be supposed to have
been detained by sickness, is represented, in the legend, as confined by
Fairy charms in an enchanted castle situated in the sea. The ruins of
ancient edifices are still visible on the summits of most of those
small islands, or rather insulated rocks, which lie along the coast of
Ayrshire and Galloway; as Ailsa and Big Scaur.</p>

<p>This edition of the ballad obtained is composed of verses selected from
three MS. copies, and two from recitation. Two of the copies are in
Herd's MSS.; the third in that of Mrs Brown of Falkland.</p>

<p>A fragment of the original song, which is sometimes denominated <i>Lord
Gregory</i>, or <i>Love Gregory</i>, was published in Mr Herd's Collection,
1774, and, still more fully, in that of Laurie and Symington, 1792. The
story has been celebrated both by Burns and Dr Wolcott.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Nor sic I seem to be;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But I am the lass of Lochroyan,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">For to wait her upon.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then up and spake him, Brown Robin,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;And what needs this?&quot; quo' he;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Or what can woman do for you,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;'Twas never my mother's fashion,&quot; she said,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Nor shall it e'er be mine,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;That belted knights should e'er remain</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;While ladyes dree'd their pain.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But, gin ye take that bugle-horn,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And blawn baith loud and shrill;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sweet William started at the sound,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O they hae fought the wood within,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Till the sun was going down;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And drops o' blood, frae Rose the Red,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Came pouring to the ground.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She leant her back against an aik,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Said&mdash;&quot;Robin, let me be:</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;For it is a ladye, bred and born,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;That has fought this day wi' thee.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O seven foot he started back.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Cried&mdash;&quot;Alas and woe is me!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;For I wished never, in all my life,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;A woman's bluid to see:</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And that all for the knightly vow</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;I swore to Our Ladye;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But mair for the sake o' ae fair maid,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Whose name was White Lilly.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now word has gane through all the land,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Before a month was gane,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That a forester's page, in gude grene-wood,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Had borne a bonny son.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The marvel gaed to the king's court,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And to the king himsell;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Now, by my fay,&quot; the king did say,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;The like was never heard tell!&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then out and spake him, Bauld Arthur,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And laugh'd right loud and hie&mdash;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I trow some may has plaid the lown,<a name="FNanchor_A_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_134"><sup>[A]</sup></a></span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Bring me my steid!&quot; the king can say;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;My bow and arrows keen;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And I'll gae hunt in yonder wood,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;And see what's to be seen.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Gin it please your grace,&quot; quo' Bauld Arthur,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;My liege, I'll gang you wi';</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;That's stray'd awa frae me.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And they hae chaced in gude grene-wood,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The buck but and the rae,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till they drew near Brown Robin's hour,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">About the close o' day.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then out and spake the king himsell,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Says&mdash;&quot;Arthur, look and see,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Gin you be not your favourite page,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;That leans against yon tree.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O Arthur's ta'en a bugle-horn,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And blawn a blast sae shrill;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sweet Willie started to her feet,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And ran him quickly till.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;O wanted ye your meat, Willie,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Or wanted ye your fee?</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Or gat ye e'er an angry word,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;That ye ran awa frae me?&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I wanted nought, my master dear;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;To me ye aye was good:</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I cam to see my ae brother,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;That wons in this grene-wood.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then out bespake the king again,&mdash;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;My boy, now tell to me,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Who dwells into yon bigly bour,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;Beneath yon green aik tree?&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;O pardon me,&quot; said Sweet Willy;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;My liege I dare na tell;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And gang na near yon outlaw's bour,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;For fear they suld you kill.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;O hand your tongue, my bonny boy!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;For I winna be said nay;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But I will gang yon hour within,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Betide me weal or wae.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They have lighted frae their milk-white steids,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And saftly entered in;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there they saw her, White Lilly,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nursing her bonny young son.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Now, by the mass,&quot; the king he said,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;This is a comely sight;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I trow, instead of a forester's man,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;This is a ladye bright!&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O out and spake her, Rose the Red,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And fell low on her knee:&mdash;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;O pardon us, my gracious liege,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;And our story I'll tell thee.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Our father is a wealthy lord,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Lives into Barnisdale;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But we had a wicked step-mother,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;That wrought us meikle bale.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Yet had she twa as fu' fair sons,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;As e'er the sun did see;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And the tane o' them lo'ed my sister deir,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;And the tother said he lo'ed me.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then out and cried him, Bauld Arthur,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As by the king he stood,&mdash;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Now, by the faith of my body,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;This suld be Rose the Red!</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The king has sent for robes o' grene,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And girdles o' shining gold;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sae sune have the ladyes busked themselves,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sae glorious to behold.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then in and came him, Brown Robin,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Frae hunting o' the king's deer,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But when he saw the king himsell,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He started back for fear.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The king has ta'en Robin by the hand,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And bade him nothing dread,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But quit for aye the gude grene wood,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And cum to the court wi' speed.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The king has ta'en White Lilly's son,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And set him on his knee;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Says&mdash;&quot;Gin ye live to wield a brand,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">&quot;My bowman thou sall be.&quot;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They have ta'en them to the holy chapelle,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And there had fair wedding;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And when they cam to the king's court,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">For joy the bells did ring.</span><br>

electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
